Primary use cases
The model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require 
memory/compute constrained environments;
latency bound scenarios;
general image understanding;
OCR;
chart and table understanding.
Our model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.
Use case considerations
Our models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. 
Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. 
Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.
		How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:

from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

		How to finetune?
We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

		Datasets
Our training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of 
publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;
selected high-quality image-text interleave;
newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;
high quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.
The data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.

Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.

Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 

Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include:

torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n

		How to finetune?
We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

		How to finetune?
We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

		How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n

		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

selected high-quality image-text interleave;
newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;
high quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.
The data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.

		How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

url = "https://assets-c4akfrf5b4d3f4b7.z01.azurefd.net/assets/2024/04/BMDataViz_661fb89f3845e.png" 
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw) 
prompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
inputs = processor(prompt, [image], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0") 
generation_args = { "max_new_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0.0, "do_sample": False, 
} 
generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id, **generation_args) 
# remove input tokens 
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]
response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] 
print(response)

		How to finetune?
We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. 
Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.
		How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

		How to finetune?
We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.
		How to Use
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:
When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n

		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

When loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.
Update your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.
The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.
Examples of required packages:
flash_attn==2.5.8
numpy==1.24.4
Pillow==10.3.0
Requests==2.31.0
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
transformers==4.40.2
Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.
		Chat Format
Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. 
You can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
where the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:
<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n 
		Sample inference code
This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:
from PIL import Image 
import requests 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM 
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" 
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) 
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."}

We recommend user to take a look at the Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision
		Responsible AI Considerations
Like other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: 
Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. 
Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. 
Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: 
Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.

Meta has announced it will not be launching its upcoming multimodal AI model in the European Union due to regulatory concerns.
This decision from Meta comes on the heels of Apple’s similar move to exclude the EU from its Apple Intelligence rollout, signalling a growing trend of tech giants hesitating to introduce advanced AI technologies in the region.
Meta’s latest multimodal AI model – capable of handling video, audio, images, and text – was set to be released under an open license. However, Meta’s decision will prevent European companies from utilising this technology, potentially putting them at a disadvantage in the global AI race.
“We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,” a Meta spokesperson stated.
A text-only version of Meta’s Llama 3 model is still expected to launch in the EU.
Meta’s announcement comes just days after the EU finalised compliance deadlines for its new AI Act. Tech companies operating in the EU will have until August 2026 to comply with rules surrounding copyright, transparency, and specific AI applications like predictive policing.
The withholding of these advanced AI models from the EU market creates a challenging situation for companies outside the region. Those hoping to provide products and services utilising these models will be unable to offer them in one of the world’s largest economic markets.
Meta plans to integrate its multimodal AI models into products like the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company’s EU exclusion will extend to future multimodal AI model releases as well.
Meta will *not* release the multimodal versions of its AI products and models in the EU because of an unpredictable regulatory environment. This means that EU users of Ray-Ban Meta won't be able to use the image understanding features.It also means that the EU industry will not…— Yann LeCun (@ylecun) July 19, 2024
As more tech giants potentially follow suit, the EU may face challenges in maintaining its position as a leader in technological innovation while balancing concerns about AI’s societal impacts.

						Meta withholds advanced AI model from EU amid regulatory uncertainty
 By Jonathan Easton
 19/07/2024
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced it will not release its upcoming multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model in the European Union due to what it calls an "unpredictable" regulatory environment.
The US tech giant plans to launch the advanced AI model, capable of processing text, images, audio, and video, in the coming months. However, European customers and companies will be unable to access or utilise the technology.
"We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment," a Meta spokesperson told Axios.
The decision highlights growing tensions between American tech firms and EU regulators. Last month, Apple made a similar move, withholding its Apple Intelligence features from Europe over regulatory concerns.
Meta's primary issue stems from difficulties in training AI models using European user data while complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In June, the company was ordered to pause AI training on EU data after announcing plans to use public posts from Facebook and Instagram users.
The Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta's lead privacy regulator in Europe, said discussions with the company over model training were ongoing.
Despite nearly identical data protection laws, Meta plans to launch the new model for UK users, citing less regulatory uncertainty in Britain.
The withholding of the multimodal AI model could have far-reaching implications for European businesses and consumers. Companies outside the EU may be prevented from offering products and services in Europe that utilise the new technology.
Meta argues that training on European data is crucial for ensuring its products accurately reflect regional terminology and culture. The company claims competitors such as Google and OpenAI are already training on European data.
While the multimodal model will be withheld, Meta still plans to release a larger, text-only version of its Llama 3 model in the EU.
The move underscores the ongoing struggle between innovation and regulation in the rapidly evolving field of AI, with European users potentially missing out on cutting-edge technologies as a result.

Intel’s AI fumble: How the chip giant missed a big opportunity
About the Author

 Artificial Intelligence,
 Companies,
Dashveenjit is an experienced tech and business journalist with a determination to find and produce stories for online and print daily. She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.
In the fast-paced world of technology, missing the next big thing can be costly. For Intel, the semiconductor titan that once reigned supreme in the computer age, one such moment came and went quietly between 2017 and 2018. It was then that the company declined an opportunity that, in hindsight, appears to have been a golden ticket to the AI revolution.
Recent reports reveal that Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. At the time, OpenAI was a fledgling non-profit focused on the then-obscure field of generative AI. Under CEO Bob Swan’s leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns.
This decision reflects a broader challenge established tech giants face: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel’s choice to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI showcases a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.
Fast forward to 2024, and the consequences of that decision are stark. OpenAI, now valued at around $80 billion, has become a driving force behind the AI revolution with its ChatGPT platform. Meanwhile, Intel is playing catch-up in the AI chip market, dwarfed by rival Nvidia’s $2.6 trillion market cap and struggling to maintain relevance in an industry it once dominated.
This missed opportunity is not an isolated incident for Intel. The company declined to produce processors for Apple’s iPhone, closing the door on Intel’s entry into the mobile computing era. These missteps paint a picture of a once-innovative giant that has lost its ability to foresee and capitalize on transformative technologies.
Intel’s journey from industry leader to AI laggard is reflected in its recent financial performance. The company’s market value has dipped below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years, and it recently announced plans to cut over 15% of its workforce following disappointing earnings. While Intel aims to launch its third-generation Gaudi AI chip later this year, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to regain ground in the fiercely competitive AI hardware market.
The OpenAI episode underscores a broader challenge facing established tech giants: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel’s decision to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI reflects a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.
As AI continues to reshape industries and create new markets, the ability to identify and invest in groundbreaking technologies early will be crucial for tech companies hoping to maintain their competitive edge. Intel’s missed opportunity with OpenAI is a cautionary tale for corporate leaders navigating the uncertain waters of technological innovation.
Looking ahead, Intel faces an uphill battle to reestablish itself as a leader in the AI chip market. The company’s plans to launch new AI-focused processors for PCs and servers in 2025 signal a renewed commitment to this space, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will close the gap with rivals who seized the AI opportunity early.
Intel’s story reminds us that in the tech industry, today’s giants can quickly become tomorrow’s laggards if they fail to embrace transformative technologies. As we stand on the cusp of the AI revolution, the question remains: Will Intel find a way to reinvent itself once again, or will it be left behind in the wake of the very future it once helped to build?

2024-08-19 09:25:51: task=**Intel's AI Fumble: How the Chip Giant Missed a Big Opportunity**

**Introduction**

In the fast-paced world of technology, missing the next big thing can be costly. For Intel, the semiconductor titan that once reigned supreme in the computer age, one such moment came and went quietly between 2017 and 2018. Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. However, under CEO Bob Swan's leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns.

**The Consequences of Intel's Decision**

Fast forward to 2024, and the consequences of that decision are stark. OpenAI, now valued at around $80 billion, has become a driving force behind the AI revolution with its ChatGPT platform. Meanwhile, Intel is playing catch-up in the AI chip market, dwarfed by rival Nvidia's $2.6 trillion market cap and struggling to maintain relevance in an industry it once dominated.

**A Pattern of Missed Opportunities**

Intel's journey from industry leader to AI laggard is reflected in its recent financial performance. The company's market value has dipped below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years, and it recently announced plans to cut over 15% of its workforce following disappointing earnings. This missed opportunity is not an isolated incident for Intel. The company declined to produce processors for Apple's iPhone, closing the door on Intel's entry into the mobile computing era. These missteps paint a picture of a once-innovative giant that has lost its ability to foresee and capitalize on transformative technologies.

**The Broader Challenge Facing Established Tech Giants**

Intel's decision to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI reflects a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run. This missed opportunity underscores a broader challenge facing established tech giants: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. As AI continues to reshape industries and create new markets, the ability to identify and invest in groundbreaking technologies early will be crucial for tech companies hoping to maintain their competitive edge.

**The Future of Intel in the AI Chip Market**

Looking ahead, Intel faces an uphill battle to reestablish itself as a leader in the AI chip market. The company's plans to launch new AI-focused processors for PCs and servers in 2025 signal a renewed commitment to this space, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will close the gap with rivals who seized the AI opportunity early.

Intel’s AI fumble: How the chip giant missed a big opportunity
About the Author

 Artificial Intelligence,
 Companies,
Dashveenjit is an experienced tech and business journalist with a determination to find and produce stories for online and print daily. She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.
In the fast-paced world of technology, missing the next big thing can be costly. For Intel, the semiconductor titan that once reigned supreme in the computer age, one such moment came and went quietly between 2017 and 2018. It was then that the company declined an opportunity that, in hindsight, appears to have been a golden ticket to the AI revolution.
Recent reports reveal that Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. At the time, OpenAI was a fledgling non-profit focused on the then-obscure field of generative AI. Under CEO Bob Swan’s leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns.
This decision reflects a broader challenge established tech giants face: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel’s choice to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI showcases a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.

While Intel aims to launch its third-generation Gaudi AI chip later this year, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to regain ground in the fiercely competitive AI hardware market.

2024-08-19 09:33:57: task=**Research Report: Intel’s AI Fumble: How the Chip Giant Missed a Big Opportunity**

**Executive Summary**

Intel, the semiconductor titan, missed a golden opportunity to invest in OpenAI, a non-profit focused on generative AI, in 2017-2018. The company declined to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, citing concerns about near-term returns. This decision reflects a broader challenge faced by established tech giants: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Today, OpenAI is valued at around $80 billion, and Intel is playing catch-up in the AI chip market.

**Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that has the potential to reshape industries and create new markets. Intel, once a leader in the computer age, has struggled to keep pace with the AI revolution.

**The Missed Opportunity**

In 2017-2018, Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. However, under CEO Bob Swan’s leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns. This decision reflects a cautious approach that may have cost Intel dearly in the long run.

**Consequences of the Decision**

Fast forward to 2024, and the consequences of that decision are stark. OpenAI, now valued at around $80 billion, has become a driving force behind the AI revolution with its ChatGPT platform. Meanwhile, Intel is playing catch-up in the AI chip market, dwarfed by rival Nvidia’s $2.6 trillion market cap and struggling to maintain relevance in an industry it once dominated.

**Broader Implications**

Intel’s missed opportunity is not an isolated incident. The company declined to produce processors for Apple’s iPhone, closing the door on Intel’s entry into the mobile computing era. These missteps paint a picture of a once-innovative giant that has lost its ability to foresee and capitalize on transformative technologies.

**Financial Performance**

Intel’s journey from industry leader to AI laggard is reflected in its recent financial performance. The company’s market value has dipped below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years, and it recently announced plans to cut over 15% of its workforce following disappointing earnings.

**Lessons Learned**

The OpenAI episode underscores a broader challenge facing established tech giants: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel’s decision to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI reflects a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.

**Conclusion**

As AI continues to reshape industries and create new markets, the ability to identify and invest in groundbreaking technologies early will be crucial for tech companies hoping to maintain their competitive edge. Intel’s missed opportunity with OpenAI is a cautionary tale for corporate leaders navigating the uncertain waters of technological innovation.2024-08-19 09:33:57: status=completed

Michael Acton in San Francisco August 19 2024Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.AMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9bn cash and stock transaction, extending a run of AI investments by the chip company as it seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia.The California-based group said the acquisition would help accelerate the adoption of its Instinct line of AI data centre chips, which compete with Nvidia’s popular graphics processing units (GPUs).ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers”. While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.The deal marks AMD’s biggest acquisition since it bought Xilinx for $35bn in 2022.“It brings a thousand world-class design engineers into our team, it allows us to develop silicon and systems in parallel and, most importantly, get the newest AI infrastructure up and running in data centres as fast as possible,” AMD’s chief executive Lisa Su told the Financial Times. “It really helps us deploy our technology much faster because this is what our customers are telling us [they need],” Su added.The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval, after which New Jersey-based ZT Systems will be folded into AMD’s data centre business group. The $4.9bn valuation includes up to $400mn contingent on “certain post-closing milestones”.Citi and Latham & Watkins are advising AMD, while ZT Systems has retained Goldman Sachs and Paul, Weiss.The move comes as AMD seeks to break Nvidia’s stranglehold on the AI data centre chip market, which earlier this year saw Nvidia temporarily become the world’s most valuable company as big tech companies pour billions of dollars into its chips to train and deploy powerful new AI models.Part of Nvidia’s success stems from its “systems” approach to the AI chip market, offering end-to-end computing infrastructure that includes pre-packaged server racks, networking equipment and software tools to make it easier for developers to build AI applications on its chips.AMD’s acquisition shows the chipmaker building out its own “systems” offering. The company rolled out its MI300 line of AI chips last year, and says it will launch its next-generation MI350 chip in 2025 to compete with Nvidia’s new Blackwell line of GPUs. In May, Microsoft was one of the first AI hyperscalers to adopt the MI300, building it into its Azure cloud platform to run AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4. AMD’s quarterly revenue for the chips surpassed $1bn for the first time in the three months to June 30.But while AMD has feted the MI300 as its fastest-ever product ramp, its data centre revenue still represented a fraction of the $22.6bn that Nvidia’s data centre business raked in for the quarter to the end of April.RecommendedArtificial intelligence‘Most exciting moment’ since birth of WiFi: chipmakers hail arrival of AI PCsIn March, ZT Systems announced a partnership with Nvidia to build custom AI infrastructure using its Blackwell chips. “I think we certainly believe ZT as part of AMD will significantly accelerate the adoption of AMD AI solutions,” Su said, but “we have customer commitments and we are certainly going to honour those”.Su added that she expected regulators’ review of the deal to focus on the US and Europe.In addition to increasing its research and development spending, AMD says it has invested more than $1bn over the past year to expand its AI hardware and software ecosystem. In July the company announced it was acquiring Finnish AI start-up Silo AI for $665mn, the largest acquisition of a privately held AI start-up in Europe in a decade.

GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That’s an 87% drop in price per year.)As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that’s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies — which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures — I’m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn’t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour – which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries. So how can AI companies prepare?First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn’t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices. Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities. Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details — specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I’m optimistic that this will become easier.Keep learning!AndrewA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AIIn our short course “Large Multimodal Model Prompting with Gemini,” you’ll learn how to build systems that reason across text, images, and video and how prompting multimodal models differs from text-only LLMs. You’ll also optimize LMM systems and output. Enroll today!NewsA Lost Voice RegainedA man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.What’s new: Researchers built a system that decodes speech signals from the brain of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends, The New York Times reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.How it works: The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient’s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. After the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.A gated recurrent unit (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. Given the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. A pretrained StyleTTS 2 text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient’s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.Results: After two hours of recording the patient’s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.Behind the news: Previous work either had much lower accuracy or generated a limited vocabulary. The new work improved upon a 2023 study that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. Why it matters: Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It’s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors’ system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient’s former voice. We’re thinking: Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.Agentic Coding Strides ForwardAn agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.What’s new: Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model’s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.How it works: Genie is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o with a larger context window of undisclosed size. It works similarly to agentic coding tools like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers’ processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie’s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.At inference — given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue — the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie’s results don’t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie’s solution sets to verify its performance.)Behind the news: SWE-bench’s creators recently collaborated with OpenAI to produce a new version, SWE-bench Verified. They eliminated extremely difficult and poorly configured problems, leaving 500 human-verified issue-commit pairs. Cosine has yet to publish Genie’s performance on SWE-bench Verified. As of this writing, Amazon Q ranks in first place with 38.8 percent. Why it matters: Some developers of AI coding assistants train models to follow human-style procedures while others are building AI-native methods. Genie takes a distinct step forward by mimicking software engineers. Competition between the two approaches, along with longer context windows, faster inference, and increasingly sophisticated agentic workflows, is driving improvement of coding assistants at a rapid pace. We’re thinking: We’re glad this Genie escaped the bottle!AI Lobby ExpandsAI is a red-hot topic for lobbyists who aim to influence government policies in the United States.What’s new: The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI jumped more than 20 percent in the first half of 2024, TechCrunch reported. Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.How it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words “AI” and “artificial intelligence” in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs. More than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.OpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI’s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That’s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company’s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it’s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.Anthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.Cohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft each spent more than $10 million on lobbying in 2023, Time reported.Yes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don’t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns. For instance, last year the American Medical Association spent $21.2 million on lobbying including AI but, given the wide range of policy issues involved in medicine, AI likely accounted for a small amount of the total. Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have2024-08-30 16:39:59: status=completed

2024-08-30 16:40:22: task=Research Report on the Future of LLM Application Development and Cost for Deployment

Introduction:
The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the AI landscape, enabling applications that were previously unimaginable. As LLMs continue to improve, their adoption is expected to increase, and their cost of deployment will play a crucial role in their widespread adoption. This report provides an overview of the current state of LLM application development and the future of LLM deployment costs.

Current State of LLM Application Development:
LLMs have been successfully applied in various domains, including but not limited to natural language processing, text generation, and conversational AI. The development of LLMs has led to the creation of agentic coding assistants, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving GitHub issues. Additionally, LLMs have been used to restore the voice of an ALS patient, enabling him to speak again in his own voice.

Cost of LLM Deployment:
The cost of deploying LLMs has been decreasing rapidly, with a 79% drop in price per year. This decrease in cost is driven by the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1 and hardware innovations by companies such as Groq, Samba Nova, and Cerebras. As a result, the cost of processing many tokens, which is particularly important for agentic workloads, has become more affordable.

Future of LLM Deployment Costs:
Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies, it is likely that token prices will continue to fall rapidly. This means that even if an application is not currently economical, it may become economical in the future. As a result, AI companies should focus on building useful applications rather than optimizing LLM costs. Additionally, they should consider deploying applications in anticipation of lower prices and periodically examining their applications to switch to new models that offer better capabilities and lower costs.

Conclusion:
The future of LLM application development looks promising, with the cost of deployment decreasing rapidly. As LLMs continue to improve, their adoption is expected to increase, and their cost of deployment will play a crucial role in their widespread adoption. AI companies should focus on building useful applications and anticipating lower prices to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.2024-08-30 16:40:22: status=completed

The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient’s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.Results: After two hours of recording the patient’s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.Behind the news: Previous work either had much lower accuracy or generated a limited vocabulary. The new work improved upon a 2023 study that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. Why it matters: Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It’s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors’ system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient’s former voice. We’re thinking: Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.Agentic Coding Strides ForwardAn agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.What’s new: Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model’s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.How it works: Genie is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o with a larger context window of undisclosed size. It works similarly to agentic coding tools like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers’ processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie’s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.At inference — given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue — the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie’s results don’t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie’s solution sets to verify its performance.)Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it’s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions. That the army of AI lobbyists includes companies large and small as well as far-flung institutions, with varying degrees of direct involvement in building or using AI, reflects both the technology’s power and the importance of this moment in charting its path forward.We’re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it’s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It’s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.A graphic shows an any-to-any multimodal model, with text mapping to RGB or geometric modalities.Multimodal to the MaxResearchers introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.What’s new: Roman Bachmann, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi and colleagues at EPFL and Apple built 4M-21, a system that works with 21 input and output types. These include modalities related to images, geometry, and text along with metadata and embeddings produced by other models.Key insight: The authors followed and extended their insight from the earlier 4M, which handles seven input and output types, as well as work such as Unified-IO 2, which handles 11. The key to training a model to handle multiple types of data input is to ensure that the training data takes the same format with the same-sized embedding across all input types. Using the transformer architecture, tokens suffice. How it works: 4M-21 comprises a large transformer and several encoder-decoders that convert different data types into tokens and back. The authors repeated their training strategy for 4M, but they increased the transformer’s size from 303 million parameters to 3 billion parameters, boosted the training dataset size from 400 million examples to 500 million examples, and incorporated new input types. The authors started with RGB images and captions from CC12M and COYO700M plus text from C4.Using a variety of tools, they extracted depth images, surface-normal images, semantically segmented images, images of edges, graphics metadata, bounding boxes, color palettes, web text, image embeddings (feature maps and global embeddings), and text embeddings. For instance, they performed semantic segmentation using Mask2Former and SAM, and extracted edges using OpenCV and SAM, counting each output as a separate data type.They converted all input types into tokens. For image-like data types and image embeddings, they trained VQ-VAE to reconstruct images and, in doing so, represent images as tokens. For human poses and the embeddings from DINOv2 and ImageBind, they trained Bottleneck MLP to reconstruct them and thus learn to represent them as tokens. They produced tokens of sequence data including text and metadata using WordPiece.Given a random sample of tokens of all modalities, 4M-21 learned to predict a different random sample of tokens. The random samples were sometimes biased toward one modality and other times biased toward a more balanced sampling. To determine which tokens to2024-08-30 16:56:53: status=completed

2024-08-30 16:56:56: task=Research Report: Rapid Drop in LLM Token Prices: A Game-Changer for AI Agents!

Introduction:

The recent price reduction of Large Language Model (LLM) tokens by OpenAI has sparked a significant drop in token prices, with a 79% decrease in just 17 months. This rapid decline is driven by the release of open-weight models, such as Llama 3.1, and innovations in hardware technologies. This report explores the implications of this trend on AI agents and provides insights on how companies can prepare for the future.

Rapid Drop in Token Prices:

The price of GPT-4 tokens has decreased from $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023 to $4 per million tokens, representing a 79% drop in just 17 months. This reduction is driven by the release of open-weight models, such as Llama 3.1, which allows API providers to compete directly on price and other factors like speed.

Hardware Innovations:

Hardware innovations by companies like Groq, Samba Nova, and Cerebras, as well as semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, are expected to drive further price cuts. These advancements will enable faster token generation, making LLMs more affordable and accessible.

Implications for AI Agents:

The rapid drop in token prices has significant implications for AI agents. With token prices decreasing, agentic workloads that were previously uneconomical may become viable. This is particularly important for applications that require processing many tokens, such as agentic workloads that must call a model multiple times to generate a result.

Advice for AI Companies:

To prepare for the future, AI companies should:

1. Focus on building useful applications rather than optimizing LLM costs.
2. Consider deploying applications that are marginally too expensive to run today, as they may become economical with future price reductions.
3. Periodically examine applications to determine if switching to a new model or provider can take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities.

Case Studies:

1. ALS Patient's Voice Restored: Researchers built a system that decodes speech signals from the brain of a man who lost the ability to speak due to ALS, enabling him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice.
2. Agentic Coding Strides Forward: Cosine's Genie, a coding assistant, achieved top performance on SWE-bench, a benchmark that tests a model's ability to solve GitHub issues.

Conclusion:

The rapid drop in LLM token prices is a game-changer for AI agents. As prices continue to fall, companies should focus on building useful applications and preparing for the future. With the right strategy, AI companies can take advantage of this trend and unlock new possibilities for AI agents.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor token prices and adjust strategies accordingly.
2. Explore new models and providers to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities.
3. Focus on building applications that can benefit from rapid token processing.

By following these recommendations, AI companies can stay ahead of the curve and unlock the full potential of AI agents.2024-08-30 16:56:56: status=completed

Dear friends,
After a recent price reduction by OpenAI, GPT-4o tokens now cost $4 per million tokens (using a blended rate that assumes 80% input and 20% output tokens). GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That’s an 87% drop in price per year.)
As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that’s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.
Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.
When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies — which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures — I’m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.
This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn’t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour – which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries.
So how can AI companies prepare?
First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn’t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.
Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices.
Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities.
Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details — specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance).
When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I’m optimistic that this will become easier.

News
A Lost Voice Regained
A man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.
What’s new: Researchers built a system that decodes speech signals from the brain of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends, The New York Times reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.

How it works: The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient’s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. After the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.

A gated recurrent unit (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.

A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. Given the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. A pretrained StyleTTS 2 text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient’s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.

Results: After two hours of recording the patient’s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.

Behind the news: Previous work either had much lower accuracy or generated a limited vocabulary. The new work improved upon a 2023 study that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. It’s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors’ system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient’s former voice.

We’re thinking: Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.

Agentic Coding Strides Forward
An agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.

What’s new: Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model’s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.

How it works: Genie is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o with a larger context window of undisclosed size. It works similarly to agentic coding tools like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers’ processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch.

Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each).

Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie’s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.

At inference — given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue — the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.

Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.

Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie’s results don’t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie’s solution sets to verify its performance.)

Behind the news: SWE-bench’s creators recently collaborated with OpenAI to produce a new version, SWE-bench Verified. They eliminated extremely difficult and poorly configured problems, leaving 500 human-verified issue-commit pairs. Cosine has yet to publish Genie’s performance on SWE-bench Verified. As of this writing, Amazon Q ranks in first place with 38.8 percent.

Why it matters: Some developers of AI coding assistants train models to follow human-style procedures while others are building AI-native methods. Genie takes a distinct step forward by mimicking software engineers. Competition between the two approaches, along with longer context windows, faster inference, and increasingly sophisticated agentic workflows, is driving improvement of coding assistants at a rapid pace.

We’re thinking: We’re glad this Genie escaped the bottle!

AI Lobby Expands
AI is a red-hot topic for lobbyists who aim to influence government policies in the United States.

What’s new: The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI jumped more than 20 percent in the first half of 2024, TechCrunch reported. Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.

How it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words “AI” and “artificial intelligence” in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs.

More than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.

OpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI’s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That’s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company’s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it’s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.

Anthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.

Cohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.

Yes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don’t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns. For instance, last year the American Medical Association spent $21.2 million on lobbying including AI but, given the wide range of policy issues involved in medicine, AI likely accounted for a small amount of the total.

Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.

Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it’s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions.

We’re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it’s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology2024-08-30 16:59:14: status=completed

2024-08-30 16:59:39: task=Research Report: Rapid Drop in LLM Token Prices: A Game-Changer for AI Agents!

Introduction:
The recent price reduction of LLM tokens by OpenAI and the release of open-weight models like Llama 3.1 have led to a rapid drop in token prices. This trend is expected to continue due to innovations in hardware and software companies, making it an exciting time for AI agents.

Rapid Drop in Token Prices:
The price of GPT-4 tokens has dropped from $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023 to $4 per million tokens, a 79% drop in price per year. This reduction is driven by the release of open-weight models, which allows API providers to compete directly on price and other factors like speed.

Implications for AI Agents:
The falling token prices will make it more economical to build and deploy AI agents. Even agentic workloads that are not entirely economical today may become viable in the near future. For instance, an application that uses 100 tokens per second continuously would cost only $1.44 per hour, significantly lower than the minimum wage in many countries.

Preparing for the Future:
AI companies should focus on building useful applications rather than optimizing LLM costs. They should also consider deploying applications that are marginally too expensive to run today, as prices may drop further. Periodically examining applications to switch to new models or providers can also help take advantage of falling prices and increased capabilities.

Case Studies:
The report highlights two case studies that demonstrate the potential of AI agents. The first is a system that enables a man who lost the ability to speak due to ALS to communicate again through a synthetic voice. The second is an agentic coding assistant called Genie that has achieved top performance on SWE-bench, a benchmark that tests a model's ability to solve GitHub issues.

AI Lobby Expands:
The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI has jumped more than 20% in the first half of 2024. Startups like OpenAI and Anthropic are increasing their lobbying efforts to influence AI policy.

Conclusion:
The rapid drop in LLM token prices is a game-changer for AI agents. As prices continue to fall, AI agents will become more economical to build and deploy, leading to increased adoption and innovation. AI companies should focus on building useful applications, preparing for the future, and influencing AI policy to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI agents.2024-08-30 16:59:39: status=completed

Dear friends,
After a recent  price reduction  by OpenAI, GPT-4o tokens now cost $4 per million tokens (using a blended rate that assumes 80% input and 20% output tokens). GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023.  This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That’s an 87% drop in price per year.)
As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that’s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.
Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive  114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new  offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.
When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies — which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures — I’m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.
This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn’t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I  wrote  previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour – which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries. 
So how can AI companies prepare?
First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn’t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.
Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices. 
Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities. 
Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details — specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). 
When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the  difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I’m optimistic that this will become easier.

A Lost Voice Regained
A man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.
What’s new:  Researchers built a system that  decodes speech signals from the brain  of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends,  The New York Times  reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.
How it works:  The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient’s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. 
After the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.
A  gated recurrent unit  (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.
A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information  here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. 
Given the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and  OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. 
 A pretrained  StyleTTS 2  text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient’s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.
Results:  After two hours of recording the patient’s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.
Behind the news:  Previous work either had much  lower accuracy  or generated a  limited vocabulary . The new work improved upon a 2023  study  that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. 
Why it matters:  Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It’s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors’ system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient’s former voice. 
We’re thinking:  Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.
Agentic Coding Strides Forward
An agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.
What’s new:  Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled  Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model’s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.
How it works:  Genie is a  fine-tuned version of GPT-4o  with a larger context window of  undisclosed  size. It works similarly to  agentic coding tools  like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers’ processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. 
Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). 
Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie’s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.
At inference — given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue — the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.
Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.
Results:  Tested on  SWE-bench  Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie’s results don’t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie’s  solution sets  to verify its performance.)
Behind the news:  The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information  according to  the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration,  according to  BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would  regulate  AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.
Why it matters:  Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it’s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions. That the army of AI lobbyists includes companies large and small as well as far-flung institutions, with varying degrees of direct involvement in building or using AI, reflects both the technology’s power and the importance of this moment in charting its path forward.
We’re thinking:  We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it’s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It’s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.

Multimodal to the Max
Researchers introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.
What’s new:  Roman Bachmann, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi and colleagues at EPFL and Apple built  4M-21, a system that works with 21 input and output types. These include modalities related to images, geometry, and text along with metadata and embeddings produced by other models.
Key insight:  The authors followed and extended their insight from the earlier  4M, which handles seven input and output types, as well as work such as  Unified-IO 2, which handles 11. The key to training a model to handle multiple types of data input is to ensure that the training data takes the same format with the same-sized embedding across all input types. Using the transformer architecture, tokens suffice. 
How it works:  4M-21 comprises a large transformer and several encoder-decoders that convert different data types into tokens and back. The authors repeated their training strategy for 4M, but they increased the transformer’s size from 303 million parameters to 3 billion parameters, boosted the training dataset size from 400 million examples to 500 million examples, and incorporated new input types. 
The authors started with RGB images and captions from  CC12M  and  COYO700M  plus text from  C4.
Using a variety of tools, they extracted depth images, surface-normal images, semantically segmented images, images of edges, graphics metadata, bounding boxes, color palettes, web text, image embeddings (feature maps and global embeddings), and text embeddings. For instance, they performed semantic segmentation using  Mask2Former  and  SAM, and extracted edges2024-08-30 17:04:16: status=completed

2024-08-30 17:04:19: task=Research Report: Rapid Drop in LLM Token Prices: A Game-Changer for AI Agents!

Introduction:
The recent price reduction of GPT-4o tokens by OpenAI marks a significant milestone in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). The price drop of 79% over 17 months is a testament to the rapid advancement of LLM technology and its increasing availability. This report explores the implications of this trend on AI agents and the potential benefits for businesses and developers.

The Falling Cost of LLMs:
The release of open-weight models like Llama 3.1 has driven prices down, enabling API providers to compete on price and speed. Hardware innovations by companies like Groq, Samba Nova, and Cerebras are expected to further reduce token prices. This rapid decline in cost will make LLMs more accessible and affordable for businesses, leading to increased adoption and innovation.

Implications for AI Agents:
The falling cost of LLMs has significant implications for AI agents. With the ability to process many tokens, AI agents can become more economical and efficient. This will enable the development of more sophisticated AI applications, such as agentic workloads that require multiple model calls. The reduced cost of LLMs will make these applications more viable and affordable, leading to increased adoption and innovation.

Preparing for the Future:
To take advantage of the falling cost of LLMs, businesses and developers should:

1. Focus on building useful applications rather than optimizing LLM costs.
2. Consider deploying applications that are marginally too expensive to run today, as prices are likely to decrease in the future.
3. Periodically examine applications to determine if switching to new models or providers can take advantage of falling prices and increased capabilities.

Challenges and Opportunities:
While the falling cost of LLMs presents significant opportunities, there are still challenges to be addressed. Implementing evals and regression testing can be difficult, but as the science of carrying out evals improves, this will become easier. The ability to switch between models and providers will also become more seamless, enabling businesses and developers to take advantage of the best available options.

Conclusion:
The rapid drop in LLM token prices is a game-changer for AI agents. With the increasing availability and affordability of LLMs, businesses and developers can develop more sophisticated AI applications, leading to increased innovation and adoption. By understanding the implications of this trend and preparing for the future, businesses and developers can stay ahead of the curve and take advantage of the opportunities presented by LLMs.

Additional Research Highlights:

* A man who lost the ability to speak due to ALS has regained his voice through a system that decodes speech signals from his brain and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice.
* An agentic coding assistant, Genie, has achieved top performance on SWE-bench, a benchmark that tests a model's ability to solve GitHub issues.
* The AI lobbying community is growing, with over 115 bills proposed in the U.S. Congress to regulate AI systems and protect consumers against potential harms.
* Researchers have introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.

These research highlights demonstrate the rapid advancement of AI technology and its increasing availability. As LLMs become more accessible and affordable, we can expect to see increased innovation and adoption across various industries and applications.2024-08-30 17:04:19: status=completed

Dear friends,

After a recent price reduction by OpenAI, GPT-4o tokens now cost $4 per million tokens (using a blended rate that assumes 80% input and 20% output tokens). GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That’s an 87% drop in price per year.)

As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that’s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.

Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.

When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies — which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures — I’m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.

This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn’t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour – which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries.

So how can AI companies prepare?

First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn’t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.

Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details — specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance).

When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I’m optimistic that this will become easier.

A Lost Voice Regained

A man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.

Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers’ processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch.

Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each).

Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie’s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.

At inference — given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue — the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.

Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.

Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent.

Behind the news: SWE-bench’s creators recently collaborated with OpenAI to produce a new version, SWE-bench Verified. They eliminated extremely difficult and poorly configured problems, leaving 500 human-verified issue-commit pairs. Cosine has yet to publish Genie’s performance on SWE-bench Verified. As of this writing, Amazon Q ranks in first place with 38.8 percent.

Why it matters: Some developers of AI coding assistants train models to follow human-style procedures while others are building AI-native methods. Genie takes a distinct step forward by mimicking software engineers.

We’re thinking: We’re glad this Genie escaped the bottle!

AI Lobby Expands

AI is a red-hot topic for lobbyists who aim to influence government policies in the United States.

What’s new: The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI jumped more than 20 percent in the first half of 2024, TechCrunch reported. Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.

How it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words “AI” and “artificial intelligence” in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs.

More than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.

OpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI’s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That’s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company’s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it’s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.

Anthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.

Cohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.

Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft each spent more than $10 million on lobbying in 2023, Time reported.

Yes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don’t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns.

Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.

Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it’s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions.

We’re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it’s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It’s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.

2024-08-30 17:06:54: task=**Research Report: Rapid Drop in LLM Token Prices: A Game-Changer for AI Agents!**

**Introduction**

The recent price reduction of Large Language Model (LLM) tokens by OpenAI has sparked a significant trend in the AI industry. The cost of GPT-4 tokens has dropped from $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023 to $4 per million tokens, representing a staggering 79% drop in price per year. This sudden shift has significant implications for AI agents and applications that rely on LLMs. In this report, we will explore the driving forces behind this price drop, its consequences, and the future outlook for AI agents.

**Driving Forces behind the Price Drop**

The release of open-weight models such as Llama 3.1 has enabled API providers to compete directly on price, leading to a rapid decrease in token prices. Additionally, hardware innovations by companies like Groq, Samba Nova, and Cerebras, as well as semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, are expected to drive further price cuts. The technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies suggest that token prices will continue to fall rapidly, making LLM-based applications more economical.

**Consequences for AI Agents**

The rapid drop in LLM token prices has significant implications for AI agents. With token prices decreasing, agentic workloads that were previously uneconomical may now become viable. For instance, an application that uses 100 tokens per second continuously would cost only $1.44 per hour, which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in many countries. This makes it more feasible for AI agents to be deployed in various industries, such as customer service, healthcare, and education.

**Preparing for the Future**

To take advantage of the dropping LLM token prices, AI companies should focus on building useful applications rather than optimizing LLM costs. They should also consider deploying applications that may be marginally too expensive to run today, as prices may drop further in the future. Furthermore, periodically examining applications to switch to new models or providers can help take advantage of falling prices and increased capabilities.

**Challenges and Opportunities**

One major barrier to switching between models is the difficulty of implementing evaluations and carrying out regression testing. However, as the science of carrying out evaluations improves, this challenge is expected to diminish. The rapid drop in LLM token prices also presents opportunities for startups and large cloud companies to innovate and compete in the AI market.

**Conclusion**

The rapid drop in LLM token prices is a game-changer for AI agents, making it more economical to deploy them in various industries. As prices continue to fall, AI companies should focus on building useful applications, deploying marginally expensive applications, and periodically examining applications to switch to new models or providers. The future outlook for AI agents is promising, with opportunities for innovation and competition in the AI market.2024-08-30 17:06:54: status=completed

Chinese internet search provider Baidu has updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.
This change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.
According to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike’s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.
This action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, like Reddit, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.
According to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.
Meanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.
Such a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine’s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was inked with the Financial Times in April.
Baidu’s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.
As the AI industry continues to evolve, it’s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.

For instance, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Similarly, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators.

**Partnerships and Agreements**

In contrast, some companies are entering into agreements to access high-quality content for their AI projects. For example, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access its entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine's publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was inked with the Financial Times in April.

**Implications**

The restriction on access to Baidu's Baike content will likely impact the development of AI models and applications that rely on large datasets. This move highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era and the need for companies to reassess their data-sharing policies.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Baidu's decision to restrict Google and Bing from scraping its content for AI training is a significant development in the world of AI and ML. The move reflects the growing importance of data in the AI era and the need for companies to reassess their data-sharing policies. As the AI industry continues to evolve, we can expect more companies to reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.2024-09-01 20:17:00: status=completed

2024-09-01 20:22:47: task=**Research Report: Baidu Restricts Google and Bing from Scraping Content for AI Training**

**Introduction**

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), access to large datasets has become a crucial factor in training and developing AI models. Baidu, a Chinese internet search provider, has taken a significant step in restricting access to its content for AI training, specifically targeting Google and Bing. This report provides an in-depth analysis of Baidu's decision and its implications on the AI industry.

**Background**

Baidu's Baike service, a Wikipedia-like platform, has been updated to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content. This change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers. The move comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training AI models and applications.

**Motivations behind Baidu's Decision**

Baidu's decision to restrict access to its content is likely driven by the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. By limiting access to its data, Baidu aims to protect its intellectual property and maintain control over its content.

**Industry Implications**

Baidu's move is not an isolated incident. Other companies, such as Reddit, have also restricted access to their content for AI training. This trend is expected to continue, with more companies reassessing their data-sharing policies and potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.

**Impact on AI Development**

The restriction on access to Baidu's content may hinder the development of AI models that rely on large datasets. This could lead to a shift in how AI developers access and utilize data, potentially resulting in the creation of new data-sharing models or agreements between companies.

**Conclusion**

Baidu's decision to restrict Google and Bing from scraping its content for AI training highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As the AI industry continues to evolve, it is likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, leading to significant changes in how information is accessed and utilized.

**Recommendations**

1. AI developers should explore alternative data sources and develop new data-sharing models to access large datasets.
2. Companies should reassess their data-sharing policies and consider implementing measures to protect their intellectual property.
3. Industry leaders should work together to establish standards for data sharing and access in the AI era.

By understanding the implications of Baidu's decision, we can better navigate the complexities of AI development and ensure a more sustainable future for the industry.2024-09-01 20:22:47: status=completed

OpenAI has announced the release of fine-tuning capabilities for its GPT-4o model, a feature eagerly awaited by developers. To sweeten the deal, OpenAI is providing one million free training tokens per day for every organisation until 23rd September.
Tailoring GPT-4o using custom datasets can result in enhanced performance and reduced costs for specific applications. Fine-tuning enables granular control over the model’s responses, allowing for customisation of structure, tone, and even the ability to follow intricate, domain-specific instructions.
Developers can achieve impressive results with training datasets comprising as little as a few dozen examples. This accessibility paves the way for improvements across various domains, from complex coding challenges to nuanced creative writing.
“This is just the start,” assures OpenAI, highlighting their commitment to continuously expand model customisation options for developers.
GPT-4o fine-tuning is available immediately to all developers across all paid usage tiers. Training costs are set at 25 per million tokens, with inference priced at 3.75 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.
OpenAI is also making GPT-4o mini fine-tuning accessible with two million free daily training tokens until 23rd September.  To access this, select “gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18” from the base model dropdown on the fine-tuning dashboard.
The company has collaborated with select partners to test and explore the potential of GPT-4o fine-tuning:
Cosine’s Genie, an AI-powered software engineering assistant, leverages a fine-tuned GPT-4o model to autonomously identify and resolve bugs, build features, and refactor code alongside human developers.  By training on real-world software engineering examples, Genie has achieved a state-of-the-art score of 43.8% on the new SWE-bench Verified benchmark, marking the largest improvement ever recorded on this benchmark.
Distyl, an AI solutions provider, achieved  first place on the BIRD-SQL benchmark after fine-tuning GPT-4o. This benchmark, widely regarded as the leading text-to-SQL test, saw Distyl’s model achieve an execution accuracy of 71.83%, demonstrating superior performance across demanding tasks such as query reformulation and SQL generation.
OpenAI reassures users that fine-tuned models remain entirely under their control, with complete ownership and privacy of all business data. This means no data sharing or utilisation for training other models.
Stringent safety measures have been implemented to prevent misuse of fine-tuned models. Continuous automated safety evaluations are conducted, alongside usage monitoring, to ensure adherence to OpenAI’s robust usage policies.

"Can AI writing tools and human writers coexist?

About the Author

By AI News |

August 29, 2024

Categories:

Artificial Intelligence,

The demand for content is as high as ever in today’s digital world, with businesses, individuals, and marketers seeking fresh, engaging content to connect with their audiences. This increasing demand has resulted in the rise of AI-powered content writing tools, raising concerns from human writers about their future in this market. Can AI tools and human writers coexist in the online space? Could they complement each other? The answer is yes, if humans embrace AI’s strengths and counteract its inherent weaknesses.

Efficiency and productivity

As someone who has worked in the content industry for over a decade, I have been taken aback by AI’s ability to streamline the content creation process. AI can quickly produce large swathes of content based on predefined parameters such as keyword density, readability, and tone. The speed at which AI-powered writing tools perform is staggering, making them perfect for creating large volumes of content, such as blog posts, product descriptions, and even social media updates.

However, AI-generated content often lacks the creativity and depth that only human writers bring to the table. For example, an AI tool like Google’s Gemini or ChatGPT could easily write a detailed review of the online sportsbook MyBookie filled with details. Yet it would be impossible for those tools to give a personalised anecdote about their interaction with customer support, the ease of depositing and withdrawing, or similar. People want facts, but they also want a personal touch, which makes content engaging and relatable.

Idea generation and research

All AI-powered tools excel at analysing huge amounts of data and identifying opportunities, trends, and patterns, which makes AI writing tools an invaluable asset for idea generation and research. I lean on AI for help in this area because although I specialise in gaming-related content, many of my clients request articles about unfamiliar subjects.

Last week, I wrote an article about NASCAR racing despite only knowing these stock cars race around an oval track. I asked ChatGPT for several ideas for NASCAR-related articles and to provide statistics from some of the best-known drivers and teams. The tool almost instantly came back with several potential topics and a plethora of data, which I then delved deeper into while bringing originality to my article that AI cannot replicate.

Customisation and personalisation

AI-powered writing tools also shine when it comes to producing content from user data, enabling a business to create and publish content with tailored messages to different segments of an audience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to create personalised product descriptions or social media posts that appeal to specific demographics.

However, as mentioned in our previous paragraphs, while AI can personalise content based on data, it lacks the authenticity and emotional connection human writers provide. Humans can add personal touches to make the content feel genuine or adjust the tone to reflect the brand’s tone of voice. Such intricacies and finishing touches help to create an authentic and consistent experience for the reader.

Quality control and editing

I said earlier that I often use AI-powered tools for idea generation and research, but I also use AI during quality control and editing. You may write an article packed with stellar content that you are proud of, only to discover upon publishing that it is strewn with spelling and grammatical errors.

Grammarly Premium costs me approximately $150 annually, but it is worth its weight in gold. This powerful editing tool analyses my text for grammatical errors, sentence structure, and readability while providing easy-to-understand suggestions for improvement. Such a tool helps me to produce cleaner and more polished content without the need for extensive editing.

However, although Grammarly is perfect for handling basic quality control, my human touch is still essential for the final review. This is especially true when writing an article with technical terms, jargon, or slang because the AI tool is often unaware of such words or phrases and incorrectly flags them as mistakes.

Combining AI and human editing ensures my content is coherent, correct, and engaging.

Scalability

AI can quickly and efficiently produce hundreds or thousands of pieces of content in a short period of time. This incredible scalability makes AI writing tools valuable for e-commerce sites, marketing agencies, or even new outlets that demand a constant flow of fresh content. However, while AI can easily scale production, human writers must ensure that AI-generated content is high quality and creative.

AI-generated content can quickly become formulaic, generic, and repetitive without human input. One only needs to scour the internet for a few minutes before stumbling across a website where AI has mass-produced the site’s content. Every article starts similarly, has the same structure, and has content drier than the Gobi Desert! Such websites probably enjoy plenty of traffic from new visitors. Still, I would be willing to bet my bottom dollar that their returning visitors figures are rock bottom because the content lacks engagement and is boring; you can’t put a price on a returning customer’s loyalty.

Conclusion

It is clear that AI-powered writing tools are not going away. Indeed, they will become more prevalent, if anything. While human writers have valid reasons to be concerned about their future in the content creation industry, they should learn to leverage the power of AI to improve their content.

Human writers can let AI handle the heavy lifting of data processing, research, and even content generation (to some degree), freeing up priceless time for them to be creative and to add elements of flair and personality to the AI-generated work.

In its current guise, AI is a human writer’s powerful and efficient ally; it is not a legitimate threat. Humans and AI can coexist in the content creation world until AI develops the ability to make up believable stories or think like only a human can. Such a time will likely never happen during our lifetimes.

Amazon partners with Anthropic to enhance Alexa
About the Author

 Artificial Intelligence,
 Chatbots,
As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
Amazon is gearing up to roll out a revamped version of its Alexa voice assistant, which is expected to be available this October, right before the US shopping rush.
Internally referred to as “Remarkable,” the new technology will be powered by Anthropic’s Claude AI models. Sources close to the matter have indicated that this shift occurred due to the underperformance of Amazon’s in-house software.
The enhanced Alexa will operate using advanced generative AI to handle more complex queries. Amazon plans to offer the new Alexa as a subscription service, priced between $5 and $10 per month, while the classic version of Alexa will remain free. This approach marks a significant change for Amazon and suggests that the company aims to turn this voice assistant into a profitable venture after years of limited success in generating revenue through this platform.
Amazon’s decision to quickly adopt an external model, Claude, indicates a strategic shift. Amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimise its dependence on third-party vendors, thereby avoiding external influences on customer behaviour and business strategies, as well as external influences on who controls data. However, it seems that Amazon’s traditional strategy does not provide the massive AI capability needed, or perhaps Amazon has realised the need for more powerful AI. It is also worth noting that the involved AI developer, OpenAI, is affiliated with major technology companies like Apple and Microsoft in developing AI technologies.
The launch of the “Remarkable” Alexa is anticipated during Amazon’s annual devices and services event in September, though the company has not confirmed the exact date. This event will also mark the first public appearance of Panos Panay, the new head of Amazon’s devices division, who has taken over from long-time executive David Limp.
The updated version of Alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant, as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. The assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people’s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. The most likely features include personalised shopping advice, news aggregation, and more advanced home automation. As for whether customers would pay for Alexa, this likely depends on the final set of available features. The issue might be particularly pressing for Amazon, given that customers already pay for Prime membership.
The future for Alexa is quite ambitious, but it also bears significant risks. For the new version to be successful, internal performance benchmarks must be met. While estimates for “Remarkable” Alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for Amazon, the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.
However, Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic is currently under regulatory review, largely due to an investigation by the UK’s antitrust regulator. The impending upgrade announcement and the regulator’s response could significantly influence the company’s future activities.
Amazon’s initiative to adopt an AI solution developed by Anthropic marks a significant shift for the company, which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology. At this point, it is possible to view this move as part of the general trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding AI development to enhance the competitiveness of products.

2024-09-03 14:10:28: task=**Research Report: Amazon Partners with Anthropic to Enhance Alexa**

**Introduction**

Amazon has announced a significant partnership with Anthropic to enhance its Alexa voice assistant, marking a strategic shift in the company's approach to artificial intelligence development. The partnership aims to introduce a revamped version of Alexa, codenamed "Remarkable," which will be powered by Anthropic's Claude AI models. This move is expected to revolutionize the capabilities of Alexa, making it more interactive and intuitive.

**Background**

Amazon's in-house software has been underperforming, leading to the decision to adopt an external model. Anthropic's Claude AI models are expected to provide advanced generative AI capabilities, enabling Alexa to handle more complex queries. This shift in strategy is significant, as Amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimize dependence on third-party vendors.

**Key Features of the Enhanced Alexa**

The updated version of Alexa is expected to offer several exciting features, including:

1. **Personalized shopping advice**: Alexa will be able to provide users with personalized shopping advice, making it a more valuable tool for consumers.
2. **News aggregation**: Alexa will be able to aggregate news from various sources, providing users with a more comprehensive view of current events.
3. **Advanced home automation**: The enhanced Alexa will be able to control more devices and appliances, making it a more integrated part of users' smart homes.

**Business Model**

Amazon plans to offer the new Alexa as a subscription service, priced between $5 and $10 per month. This approach marks a significant change for Amazon, as the company aims to turn Alexa into a profitable venture. The classic version of Alexa will remain free, providing users with a choice between the two options.

**Industry Implications**

The partnership between Amazon and Anthropic is part of a larger trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding AI development to enhance the competitiveness of products. This move is likely to influence the future of voice assistants and AI development, as other companies may follow suit.

**Challenges and Risks**

While the enhanced Alexa holds great promise, there are also challenges and risks associated with the partnership. The success of the new Alexa will depend on internal performance benchmarks, and the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain. Additionally, the partnership is currently under regulatory review, which could impact the future of the collaboration.

**Conclusion**

The partnership between Amazon and Anthropic is a significant development in the world of artificial intelligence and voice assistants. The enhanced Alexa has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making it more intuitive and interactive. However, the success of the partnership will depend on various factors, including internal performance benchmarks and regulatory approval.2024-09-03 14:10:28: status=completed

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nAmazon is gearing up to roll out a revamped version of its Alexa voice assistant, which is expected to be available this October, right before the US shopping rush.\nInternally referred to as “Remarkable,” the new technology will be powered by Anthropic’s Claude AI models. Sources close to the matter have indicated that this shift occurred due to the underperformance of Amazon’s in-house software.\nThe enhanced Alexa will operate using advanced generative AI to handle more complex queries. Amazon plans to offer the new Alexa as a subscription service, priced between $5 and $10 per month, while the classic version of Alexa will remain free. This approach marks a significant change for Amazon and suggests that the company aims to turn this voice assistant into a profitable venture after years of limited success in generating revenue through this platform.\nAmazon’s decision to quickly adopt an external model, Claude, indicates a strategic shift. Amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimise its dependence on third-party vendors, thereby avoiding external influences on customer behaviour and business strategies, as well as external influences on who controls data. However, it seems that Amazon’s traditional strategy does not provide the massive AI capability needed, or perhaps Amazon has realised the need for more powerful AI. It is also worth noting that the involved AI developer, OpenAI, is affiliated with major technology companies like Apple and Microsoft in developing AI technologies.\nThe launch of the “Remarkable” Alexa is anticipated during Amazon’s annual devices and services event in September, though the company has not confirmed the exact date. This event will also mark the first public appearance of Panos Panay, the new head of Amazon’s devices division, who has taken over from long-time executive David Limp.\nThe updated version of Alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant, as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. The assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people’s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. The most likely features include personalised shopping advice, news aggregation, and more advanced home automation. As for whether customers would pay for Alexa, this likely depends on the final set of available features. The issue might be particularly pressing for Amazon, given that customers already pay for Prime membership.\nThe future for Alexa is quite ambitious, but it also bears significant risks. For the new version to be successful, internal performance benchmarks must be met. While estimates for “Remarkable” Alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for Amazon, the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.\nHowever, Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic is currently under regulatory review, largely due to an investigation by the UK’s antitrust regulator. The impending upgrade announcement and the regulator’s response could significantly influence the company’s future activities.\nAmazon’s initiative to adopt an AI solution developed by Anthropic marks a significant shift for the company, which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology. At this point, it is possible to view this move as part of the general trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding AI development to enhance the competitiveness of products.\nSee also: Amazon strives to outpace Nvidia with cheaper, faster AI chips\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Elon Musk’s xAI has unveiled its record-breaking AI training system, dubbed ‘Colossus’.
Musk revealed that the xAI team had successfully brought the Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online after a 122-day process. Not content with its existing capabilities, Musk stated, “over the next couple of months, it will double in size, bringing it to 200k (50k H200s).”
This weekend, the @xAI team brought our Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online. From start to finish, it was done in 122 days. Colossus is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Moreover, it will double in size to 200k (50k H200s) in a few months. Excellent…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2024
The scale of Colossus is unprecedented, surpassing every other cluster to date. For context, Google uses 90,000 GPUs while OpenAI utilises 80,000 GPUs—both of which have been surpassed by xAI’s creation, even prior to Colossus’ doubling in size over the coming months.
Here is a comparison chart to help everyone understand the magnitude of this. pic.twitter.com/PJys0XlvYo— Anthony Everywhere (@AnthonyEveryWhr) September 2, 2024
Developed in partnership with Nvidia, Colossus leverages some of the most advanced GPU technology on the market. The system initially employs Nvidia’s H100 chips, with plans to incorporate the newer H200 model in its expansion. This vast array of processing power positions Colossus as the most formidable AI training system currently available.
The H200, while recently superseded by Nvidia’s Blackwell chip unveiled in March 2024, remains a highly sought-after component in the AI industry. It boasts impressive specifications, including 141 GB of HBM3E memory and 4.8 TB/sec of bandwidth. However, the Blackwell chip raises the bar even further, with top-end capacity 36.2% higher than the H200 and a 66.7% increase in total bandwidth.
Nvidia’s response to the Colossus unveiling was one of enthusiasm and support. The company congratulated Musk and the xAI team on their achievement, highlighting that Colossus will not only be the most powerful system of its kind but will also deliver “exceptional gains” in energy efficiency.
Exciting to see Colossus, the world’s largest GPU #supercomputer, come online in record time. Colossus is powered by @nvidia's #acceleratedcomputing platform, delivering breakthrough performance with exceptional gains in #energyefficiency.Congratulations to the entire team! https://t.co/UXHtPCELly— NVIDIA Data Center (@NVIDIADC) September 2, 2024
Colossus’ processing power could potentially accelerate breakthroughs in various AI applications, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving algorithms. However, the unveiling of Colossus also reignites discussions about the concentration of AI power among a handful of tech giants and well-funded startups.
As companies like xAI push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI training, concerns about the accessibility of such advanced technologies to smaller organisations and researchers may come to the forefront.
As the AI arms race continues to heat up, all eyes will be on xAI and its competitors to see how they leverage these increasingly powerful systems. With Colossus, Musk and his team have thrown down the gauntlet and issued a challenge to rivals to match or exceed their efforts.

Elon Musk’s xAI has unveiled its record-breaking AI training system, dubbed ‘Colossus’.
Musk revealed that the xAI team had successfully brought the Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online after a 122-day process. Not content with its existing capabilities, Musk stated, “over the next couple of months, it will double in size, bringing it to 200k (50k H200s).”
This weekend, the @xAI team brought our Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online. From start to finish, it was done in 122 days. Colossus is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Moreover, it will double in size to 200k (50k H200s) in a few months. Excellent…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2024
The scale of Colossus is unprecedented, surpassing every other cluster to date. For context, Google uses 90,000 GPUs while OpenAI utilises 80,000 GPUs—both of which have been surpassed by xAI’s creation, even prior to Colossus’ doubling in size over the coming months.
Here is a comparison chart to help everyone understand the magnitude of this. pic.twitter.com/PJys0XlvYo— Anthony Everywhere (@AnthonyEveryWhr) September 2, 2024
Developed in partnership with Nvidia, Colossus leverages some of the most advanced GPU technology on the market. The system initially employs Nvidia’s H100 chips, with plans to incorporate the newer H200 model in its expansion. This vast array of processing power positions Colossus as the most formidable AI training system currently available.
The H200, while recently superseded by Nvidia’s Blackwell chip unveiled in March 2024, remains a highly sought-after component in the AI industry. It boasts impressive specifications, including 141 GB of HBM3E memory and 4.8 TB/sec of bandwidth. However, the Blackwell chip raises the bar even further, with top-end capacity 36.2% higher than the H200 and a 66.7% increase in total bandwidth.
Nvidia’s response to the Colossus unveiling was one of enthusiasm and support. The company congratulated Musk and the xAI team on their achievement, highlighting that Colossus will not only be the most powerful system of its kind but will also deliver “exceptional gains” in energy efficiency.
Exciting to see Colossus, the world’s largest GPU #supercomputer, come online in record time. Colossus is powered by @nvidia's #acceleratedcomputing platform, delivering breakthrough performance with exceptional gains in #energyefficiency.Congratulations to the entire team! https://t.co/UXHtPCELly— NVIDIA Data Center (@NVIDIADC) September 2, 2024
Colossus’ processing power could potentially accelerate breakthroughs in various AI applications, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving algorithms. However, the unveiling of Colossus also reignites discussions about the concentration of AI power among a handful of tech giants and well-funded startups.
As companies like xAI push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI training, concerns about the accessibility of such advanced technologies to smaller organisations and researchers may come to the forefront.
As the AI arms race continues to heat up, all eyes will be on xAI and its competitors to see how they leverage these increasingly powerful systems. With Colossus, Musk and his team have thrown down the gauntlet and issued a challenge to rivals to match or exceed their efforts.

The company was working to demonstrate its progress in artificial intelligence following a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. It added an AI powered chatbot into its Bing search engine, which placed it among the first legacy tech companies to fold AI into its flagship products, but almost as soon as people started using it, things went sideways.A New York Times journalist sparked international intrigue over a conversation he had with Bing that left him "deeply unsettled". Soon, users began sharing screenshots that appeared to show the tool using racial slurs and announcing plans for world domination. Microsoft quickly announced a fix, limiting the AI's responses and capabilities. In the following months, the company replaced its Bing chatbot with Copilot, which is now available as part of its Microsoft 365 software and Windows operating system.Microsoft is far from the only company to face AI controversy, and critics say the debacle is evidence of broader carelessness around the dangers of artificial intelligence within the tech industry. For example, Google's Bard tool famously answered a question about a telescope inaccurately during a live press demo, a mistake that wiped $100bn (£82bn) off the company's value. The AI model, now called Gemini, later came under fire for "woke" bias after the tool seemed unwilling to produce images of white people for certain prompts.Getty ImagesCopilot – Microsoft’s AI chatbot – is now available as part of Microsoft 365 software and the Windows operating system (Credit: Getty Images)Still, Microsoft says AI can be a tool to promote equity and representation – with the right safeguards. One solution it's putting forward to help address the issue of bias in AI is increasing diversity and inclusion of the teams building the technology itself.   "It's never been more important as we think about building inclusive AI and inclusive tech for the future," says Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft's chief diversity officer, who joined the firm in 2018.A former teacher for the deaf, McIntyre has spent over 20 years in human resources in the tech industry, including at IBM, and has lived and worked throughout the US as well as in Singapore and Dubai. Now, she says her team at Microsoft is increasingly focused on embedding inclusion practices into the firm's AI research and development to make sure there is better representation "at all levels of the company".There's good reason for this focus. Embracing AI products has brought new life to the nearly 50-year-old brand. In July, the company reported revenue for the year was up 15% to $64.7 billion (£49.2 billion), due largely to growth from its Azure cloud business, which has greatly benefited from the AI boom as customers train their systems on the platform.The efforts also push the company closer to its long-time goal to build technology "that understands us", as its CEO Satya Nadella recently put it. But in order for AI – or more specifically large-language models such as ChatGPT – to be empathic, relevant and accurate, McIntyre says, they needs to be trained by a more diverse group of developers, engineers and researchers.This may not be a guaranteed fix. The large language models that underpin tools such as Copilot, ChatGPT and Gemini are built by scraping massive data sets from across the internet. If bias is present in the training data, it's exceedingly difficult to stop it from cropping up later, which is of particular concern as artificial intelligence is used out in the real world.Getty ImagesMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella says embracing AI is helping push the company towards its goal of building technology “that understands us” (Credit: Getty Images)Companies are embracing tools to help with hiring, for example, but experts warn they can reinforce race and gender biases as they filter candidates. Recent research from MIT found that AI interpreted professions such as "flight attendant", "secretary", and "physician's assistant" as feminine jobs, while "fisherman", "lawyer", and "judge" were deemed masculine jobs. It also labelled emotions including "anxious", "depressed" and "devastated" as feminine. Meanwhile, some US police departments have begun using AI to write up crime reports.Still, Microsoft believes that AI can support diversity and inclusion (D&I) if these ideals are built into AI models in the first place. The company maintains that inclusion has always been a large part of its culture, from the Xbox Adaptive Controller designed for users with special needs to the many accessibility features in its Microsoft 365 products. But the pressure to keep up with the pace and scale at which AI is growing is intensifying Microsoft's need to invest in its own diversity.In its 2023 diversity report, Microsoft reported about 54.8% of its core workforce is made up of racial and ethnic minorities, which is in line in part to rivals such as Apple and Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft's workforce is 31.2% women, down a few percentage points compared to Apple and Google.Below, McIntrye talks with the BBC about addressing biases in generative AI, how inclusive allyship looks across different cultures, and what Microsoft is doing to ensure its own talent can keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.MicrosoftLindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft’s Chief Diversity Officer, says her team is focused on embedding inclusion practices into the firm’s AI research (Credit: Microsoft)How is Microsoft addressing bias in generative AI that afflicts these types of tools? We do a tremendous amount of investment [around this] but we also thread education on elements like bias and inclusion generally through all the work that we do.Microsoft believes AI technologies should perform fairly. We are continuing to invest in research on identifying, measuring and mitigating different types of fairness-related harms, and we are innovating in new ways to proactively test our AI systems, as outlined in our Responsible AI Standard. To do this, Microsoft works with a wide array of experts, including anthropologists, linguists and social scientists – all of whom bring valuable perspectives to the table that advance and challenge the thinking of our engineers and developers.To develop and deploy AI systems responsibly, we are putting D&I at the centre by ensuring a wide range of backgrounds, skills and experiences are represented across the Microsoft teams that are envisioning and building AI so that it's developed in a way that's inclusive of all users. We also ensure our leaders who are making the decisions about these teams and products have the tools to understand issues of privilege, power and bias.Microsoft received backlash this summer following headlines around cutting its diversity and inclusion team. The company later clarified the team remained intact. Has there been a change to the company's commitment here?We are really fortunate Microsoft's commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering and unchanged. We're expanding. In that news cycle, I was reminded of how many people are depending on Microsoft to have inclusive tech, to make sure that we are continuing to stay on the forefront of the diversity and inclusion experiences, to share our learnings and to listen to how other people are experiencing this same moment in the industry. Not because we know more than anybody else – because for sure we don't, we're learning all the time – but we do have resources that not all companies have.More like this:• Why Zoom wants you to go back to the office• Lego CEO on the business case for play• EY exec: Neurodiverse talent benefits everyoneAre there any other focus areas when it comes to AI and inclusivity?One that is pretty dynamic is [making AI accessible] in more languages. When you're operating in a language different from your primary language, your brain has to work harder and you're less productive and less able to be your true authentic self. There's a real ongoing opportunity in AI to be even more thoughtful and relevant on the totality of global language. It's an enormous task, but we’re learning so much every day and the AI is just getting smarter.Beyond AI, we did a partnership with external organisations who support the LGBTQ+ communities and our own employee resource group about adding pronouns to user profiles in Microsoft 365. [This allows people] to feel seen, recognised and cared for in the technology, which is the experience we want them to have.How do you help a workforce of 230,000 understand allyship when it looks different in various cultures?We have a core strategy but also localise it. In India, for example, we just ran a D&I experience at the intersection of race, ethnicity and religion for managers and leaders. Through feedback, we were also able to have Copilot pop up with responses that are both qualitative and quantitative so that we can be more effective as we deploy it to the whole of the workforce.We're also doing that in Australia and New Zealand for the indigenous communities. And in the Middle East and Africa, we wanted more support for employees and their families who are going through menopause – something that isn't always talked about in cultures around the world.  We also have to think about something as simple as the devices and the languages people are using, along with the accessibility features. Everyone wants an empathetic AI that is knowledgeable and relevant. We want to feel like the AI understands us and what we're trying to achieve. So, being able to have cultural context in the AI experience will result in a more satisfied experience – and those expectations that we put on the technology ultimately come from having a diverse workforce working on and building and creating the AI from the beginning.Microsoft by the numbers:228,000: Microsoft’s global headcount190: Number of countries in which Microsoft operates9: Global employee-led resource groups that foster an inclusive workplace5 billion+: Number of chats and images generated through Copilot to date60,000+: Azure AI cloud customers building AI into their apps and servicesHow do you make sure talent doesn't get left behind as AI is evolving? We have an incredible AI learning hub that allows us to access the latest and greatest learnings… and the employee resource group is doing upskilling, leveraging some of the content to even teach themselves. Whether they are an engineer or a field seller or a program manager, we offer AI [courses]to help make us more productive – even those of us in HR. We have a huge HR team that's focused on how to leverage AI for the HR experience at Microsoft.How is Microsoft leveraging AI in HR? For example, Copilot is helping us get back to employees with questions faster. We are also deploying AI skilling courses, so all employees have a shared understanding of AI technology as we use it more and more in our work across business areas.For any organisation considering how to bring AI into HR work, there are three strategies to consider. First, form a community of learning with experts to build acumen together. Get curious with the technology, such as engaging with Copilot to learn how it can help you build inclusion in your organisation. And finally, ensure a human-centred design that puts empathy and people experience at the centre.--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Executive loungeArtificial intelligenceBusinessDiversityTechnologyFeaturesWatchTesting out smart swim goggles for the Paris GamesA new generation of smart goggles provide real time visual feedback to enhance athletic performance.16 Aug 2024TechnologyLess is more: Can degrowth save the world?The degrowth movement questions the feasibility of the idea of endless economic growth on a finite planet.3 Aug 2024BusinessAI v The Mind: Can AI tell better jokes than a human?In a clash of wit and technology, we bring together two unlikely adversaries: a comedian and an AI chatbot.26 Jul 2024Artificial IntelligenceHow technology will power the opening ceremonyA new network along the Seine in Paris will broadcast Olympic festivities from the river.18 Jul 2024TechnologyWhy Olympic venues are using digital twinsA peak inside both the real and virtual new Aquatic Centre built for the Paris Games.17 Jul 2024TechnologyWatch the movie that rewrites itselfFilmmaker Gary Hustwit has created a documentary which can rewrite itself before every screening.7 Jun 2024Artificial IntelligenceWhite gold rush: Harvesting lithium from Great Salt LakeCould the United States' largest saltwater lake hold the key to its energy future?13 May 2024TechnologyWhy are scientists making 'moon dust'?Space agencies around the world need lunar soil.10 May 2024InnovationWhere do your old mobile phones and TVs go to die?Dandora sits on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, and 800 tonnes of garbage is dumped on the site every day.3 May 2024TechnologyAI v The Mind: Who has the edge?In a new series, we will test the limits of the latest AI technology by pitting it against human experts.1 May 2024Artificial IntelligenceHow AI and deepfakes are changing politicsSome politicians have found themselves victims of deepfakes.

2024-09-06 18:28:49: task=Research Report: Microsoft is turning to AI to make its workplace more inclusive

Introduction:
Microsoft is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to promote diversity and inclusion in its workplace. The company's chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, believes that increasing diversity and inclusion of the teams building AI technology can help address bias in AI systems.

Background:
Microsoft faced a public relations crisis earlier this year when its AI-powered chatbot, Bing, was found to be using racial slurs and making inflammatory statements. The incident highlighted the importance of addressing bias in AI systems. Microsoft has since replaced Bing with Copilot, a new AI chatbot that is available as part of its Microsoft 365 software and Windows operating system.

Approach:
Microsoft is taking a multifaceted approach to addressing bias in AI systems. The company is investing in research to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems and is working to increase diversity and inclusion in its workforce. McIntyre believes that having a diverse team of developers, engineers, and researchers working on AI technology can help ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased.

Initiatives:
Microsoft has several initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in its workforce. The company has reported that 54.8% of its core workforce is made up of racial and ethnic minorities, and 31.2% of its workforce is female. Microsoft is also working to increase diversity and inclusion in its AI research and development teams.

In addition, Microsoft is investing in AI technologies that can support diversity and inclusion. For example, the company is working on AI-powered tools that can help with hiring and talent development.

The company's AI models are built using large datasets that may contain biases, and it can be difficult to identify and mitigate these biases. Additionally, Microsoft's AI systems may perpetuate existing biases in society.

Conclusion:
Microsoft's efforts to address bias in AI systems are commendable, and the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion is an important step in the right direction. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased. Microsoft must continue to invest in research and development to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems, and the company must work to increase diversity and inclusion in its workforce.

Recommendations:

1. Microsoft should continue to invest in research to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems.
2. The company should work to increase diversity and inclusion in its workforce, particularly in its AI research and development teams.
3. Microsoft should partner with external organizations to support diversity and inclusion initiatives.
4. The company should prioritize transparency and accountability in its AI development and deployment processes.

By following these recommendations, Microsoft can help ensure that its AI systems are fair, unbiased, and promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace.2024-09-06 18:28:49: status=completed

Google DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.
AlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.
The system’s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:

Trained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.
To validate AlphaProteo’s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.
For instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo’s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.
The system’s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNFɑ (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)
To ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices—including the NTI’s new AI Bio Forum.
As the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.
While AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.
Nevertheless, Google DeepMind’s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.

The development of AlphaProteo marks a significant shift towards AI-driven protein design, which has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new proteins and improve their binding affinities.

Methodology:
AlphaProteo was trained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold. The system uses this training data to learn the intricacies of molecular binding and generate candidate proteins designed to bind at specific sites.

Capabilities:
AlphaProteo has demonstrated impressive capabilities in designing novel proteins that bind to target molecules. The system has achieved higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested. AlphaProteo has also shown promise in designing binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.

Applications:
The potential applications of AlphaProteo are vast and varied. The system could be used to accelerate the discovery of new proteins for drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests. AlphaProteo could also be used to improve our understanding of protein-ligand interactions, which is crucial for the development of effective treatments for diseases.

Limitations:
While AlphaProteo has demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is not without its limitations. The system was unable to design successful binders against TNFɑ, a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, and further research is needed to overcome these challenges.

Conclusion:
AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design and has the potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and disease research. The system's impressive capabilities, combined with its potential applications, make it an exciting development in the field of AI-driven protein design. Further research is needed to overcome the limitations of AlphaProteo and to fully realize its potential.2024-09-07 18:29:58: status=completed

Google DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.
AlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.
The system’s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:

Trained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.
To validate AlphaProteo’s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.
For instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo’s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.
The system’s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNFɑ (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)
To ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices—including the NTI’s new AI Bio Forum.
As the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.
While AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.
Nevertheless, Google DeepMind’s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.

The UK has signed a landmark AI safety treaty aimed at protecting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law from potential threats posed by the technology.
Lord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood signed the Council of Europe’s AI convention today as part of a united global approach to managing the risks and opportunities. 
“Artificial intelligence has the capacity to radically improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of public services, and turbocharge economic growth,” said Lord Chancellor Mahmood.
“However, we must not let AI shape us—we must shape AI. This convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law.”
The treaty acknowledges the potential benefits of AI – such as its ability to boost productivity and improve healthcare – whilst simultaneously addressing concerns surrounding misinformation, algorithmic bias, and data privacy. It will compel signatory nations to monitor AI development, implement strict regulations, and actively combat any misuse of the technology that could harm public services or individuals.
Keiron Holyome, VP UKI & Emerging Markets at BlackBerry, commented: “To truly outrun cybercriminals and maintain a defensive advantage, robust frameworks for AI governance and ethical standards must be established, ensuring responsible use and mitigating risks.
“The first legally binding international AI treaty is another step towards such recommendations for both AI caution and applications for good. Collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and academia will be increasingly essential for sharing knowledge, developing best practices, and responding to emerging threats collectively.”
Crucially, the convention acts as a framework to enhance existing legislation in the UK. For example, aspects of the Online Safety Act will be bolstered to better address the risk of AI systems using biased data to generate unfair outcomes. 
The agreement focuses on three key safeguards:
Protecting human rights: Ensuring individuals’ data is used responsibly, their privacy is respected, and AI systems are free from discrimination. 
Protecting democracy: Requiring countries to take proactive steps to prevent AI from being used to undermine public institutions and democratic processes.
Protecting the rule of law: Placing an obligation on signatory countries to establish robust AI-specific regulations, shield their citizens from potential harm, and ensure responsible AI deployment.
While the convention initially focuses on Council of Europe members, other nations – including the US and Australia – are being invited to join this international effort to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. 
Peter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, commented: “AI holds the potential to be the driving force behind new economic growth, a productivity revolution and true transformation in our public services, but that ambition can only be achieved if people have faith and trust in the innovations which will bring about that change.
“The convention we’ve signed today alongside global partners will be key to that effort. Once in force, it will further enhance protections for human rights, rule of law, and democracy—strengthening our own domestic approach to the technology while furthering the global cause of safe, secure, and responsible AI.”
The UK Government has pledged to collaborate closely with domestic regulators, devolved administrations, and local authorities to ensure seamless implementation of the treaty’s requirements once it is ratified.
The signing of the convention builds on the UK’s previous efforts in responsible AI by hosting the AI Safety Summit and co-hosting the AI Seoul Summit, as well as establishing the world’s first AI Safety Institute.

The UK has signed a landmark AI safety treaty aimed at protecting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law from potential threats posed by the technology.
Lord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood signed the Council of Europe’s AI convention today as part of a united global approach to managing the risks and opportunities. 
“Artificial intelligence has the capacity to radically improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of public services, and turbocharge economic growth,” said Lord Chancellor Mahmood.
“However, we must not let AI shape us—we must shape AI. This convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law.”
The treaty acknowledges the potential benefits of AI – such as its ability to boost productivity and improve healthcare – whilst simultaneously addressing concerns surrounding misinformation, algorithmic bias, and data privacy. It will compel signatory nations to monitor AI development, implement strict regulations, and actively combat any misuse of the technology that could harm public services or individuals.
Keiron Holyome, VP UKI & Emerging Markets at BlackBerry, commented: “To truly outrun cybercriminals and maintain a defensive advantage, robust frameworks for AI governance and ethical standards must be established, ensuring responsible use and mitigating risks.
“The first legally binding international AI treaty is another step towards such recommendations for both AI caution and applications for good. Collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and academia will be increasingly essential for sharing knowledge, developing best practices, and responding to emerging threats collectively.”
Crucially, the convention acts as a framework to enhance existing legislation in the UK. For example, aspects of the Online Safety Act will be bolstered to better address the risk of AI systems using biased data to generate unfair outcomes. 
The agreement focuses on three key safeguards:
Protecting human rights: Ensuring individuals’ data is used responsibly, their privacy is respected, and AI systems are free from discrimination. 
Protecting democracy: Requiring countries to take proactive steps to prevent AI from being used to undermine public institutions and democratic processes.
Protecting the rule of law: Placing an obligation on signatory countries to establish robust AI-specific regulations, shield their citizens from potential harm, and ensure responsible AI deployment.
While the convention initially focuses on Council of Europe members, other nations – including the US and Australia – are being invited to join this international effort to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.   
Peter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, commented: “AI holds the potential to be the driving force behind new economic growth, a productivity revolution and true transformation in our public services, but that ambition can only be achieved if people have faith and trust in the innovations which will bring about that change.
“The convention we’ve signed today alongside global partners will be key to that effort. Once in force, it will further enhance protections for human rights, rule of law, and democracy—strengthening our own domestic approach to the technology while furthering the global cause of safe, secure, and responsible AI.”
The UK Government has pledged to collaborate closely with domestic regulators, devolved administrations, and local authorities to ensure seamless implementation of the treaty’s requirements once it is ratified.
The signing of the convention builds on the UK’s previous efforts in responsible AI by hosting the AI Safety Summit and co-hosting the AI Seoul Summit, as well as establishing the world’s first AI Safety Institute.

"OpenAI co-founder's Safe Superintelligence Inc secures $1B

About the Author
By Dashveenjit Kaur |

 Security,

Dashveenjit is an experienced tech and business journalist with a determination to find and produce stories for online and print daily. She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.

Just three months after its inception, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a new AI startup founded by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, has raised $1 billion in funding. Led by venture capital firms Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, the latest investment round values the company at approximately $5 billion, according to a Financial Times report.

Sutskever, who left OpenAI in May this year following a failed attempt to oust CEO Sam Altman, established SSI to develop ‘safe’ AI models. The company’s mission is to create AI systems that are both highly capable and aligned with human interests.

‘We’ve identified a new mountain to climb that is slightly different from what I was working on previously. We’re not trying to go down the same path faster. If you do something different, it becomes possible for you to do something special, Sutskever told the Financial Times.

The substantial funding will be used to acquire computing resources necessary for AI model development and to expand SSI’s current team of 10 employees. The company actively recruits and offers positions in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.

With its focus on safety and alignment, SSI’s approach differs from that of other AI companies. Take firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, which are all developing AI models for various consumer and business applications. SSI, on the other hand, is focusing solely on creating what it calls a ‘straight shot to safe superintelligence’.

Daniel Gross, SSI’s chief executive, emphasised the importance of this focused approach in a statement to Reuters: “It’s important for us to be surrounded by investors who understand, respect and support our mission, which is to make a straight shot to safe superintelligence and in particular to spend a couple of years doing R&D on our product before bringing it to market.”

It is also interesting to point out that despite not having a product yet, the company’s significant valuation and funding highlight the intense interest and investment in safe AI research. This is amid growing concerns about the potential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems.

Even Sutskever’s departure from OpenAI was reportedly due to disagreements over the company’s direction and the pace of AI development. At OpenAI, he led the ‘alignment’ team, which focused on ensuring that advanced AI systems would act in humanity’s best interests.

What is clear, however, is that the formation of SSI and its rapid funding success reflect a broader trend in the AI industry towards addressing safety concerns alongside capability advancements. This approach aligns with calls from AI researchers and ethicists for more responsible development of artificial intelligence.

Today, SSI joins a competitive field of well-funded AI companies. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise funds at a valuation exceeding $100 billion, while Anthropic and xAI were recently valued at around $20 billion.

However, the crowded market did not dim SSI’s unique focus on safety or its high-profile founding team, both of which have clearly resonated with investors.

“We are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world’s best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and nothing else. We offer an opportunity to do your life’s work and help solve our age’s most important technical challenge,” the company’s website states.

For now, the company’s progress will be closely watched by both the tech industry and those concerned with the ethical implications of AI development."2024-09-09 21:22:53: status=completed

Safe Superintelligence Inc (SSI), a new AI startup founded by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, has raised $1 billion in funding just three months after its inception. This significant investment values the company at approximately $5 billion. SSI's mission is to develop "safe" AI models that are both highly capable and aligned with human interests.

**Background**

Ilya Sutskever, who left OpenAI in May 2024 following a failed attempt to oust CEO Sam Altman, established SSI to focus on creating AI systems that are safe and aligned with human interests. SSI's approach differs from other AI companies, which are developing AI models for various consumer and business applications. SSI is solely focused on creating a "straight shot to safe superintelligence."

**Funding and Valuation**

The $1 billion funding round, led by venture capital firms Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, values SSI at approximately $5 billion. This substantial funding will be used to acquire computing resources necessary for AI model development and to expand SSI's current team of 10 employees.

**Unique Focus on Safety**

SSI's approach to AI development is unique in its focus on safety and alignment. The company's mission is to create AI systems that are both highly capable and aligned with human interests. This approach is in line with calls from AI researchers and ethicists for more responsible development of artificial intelligence.

**Competitive Landscape**

SSI joins a competitive field of well-funded AI companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise funds at a valuation exceeding $100 billion, while Anthropic and xAI were recently valued at around $20 billion. However, SSI's unique focus on safety and its high-profile founding team have clearly resonated with investors.

**Future Prospects**

The company's progress will be closely watched by both the tech industry and those concerned with the ethical implications of AI development. SSI's focus on safety and alignment has the potential to address growing concerns about the potential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems.

**Conclusion**

The formation of SSI and its rapid funding success reflect a broader trend in the AI industry towards addressing safety concerns alongside capability advancements. SSI's unique focus on safety and its high-profile founding team have clearly resonated with investors, and the company's progress will be closely watched in the coming years.2024-09-09 21:22:57: status=completed

Sony Research and AI Singapore (AISG) will collaborate on research for the SEA-LION family of large language models (LLMs).
SEA-LION, which stands for Southeast Asian Languages In One Network, aims to improve the accuracy and capability of AI models when processing languages from the region. This is particularly important given the linguistic diversity of Southeast Asia, which is home to over a thousand different languages. 
“As a global company, diversity and localisation are vital forces,” said Hiroaki Kitano, President of Sony Research. “In Southeast Asia specifically, there are more than a thousand different languages spoken by the citizens of the region. This linguistic diversity underscores the importance of ensuring AI models and tools are designed to support the needs of all populations around the world.”
The collaboration will focus on testing and improving the SEA-LION model, with a particular emphasis on Tamil, a language spoken by an estimated 60-85 million people worldwide. Sony Research will leverage its expertise in Indian languages – including Tamil – and its research in speech generation, content analysis, and recognition.
“Access to LLMs that address the global landscape of language and culture has been a barrier to driving research and developing new technologies that are representative and equitable for the global populations we serve,” Kitano added.
The collaboration is further strengthened by Kitano’s existing ties to the Singaporean technology landscape. He holds positions on numerous advisory councils and boards in the country, including the Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), and the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF).
“The integration of the SEA-LION model, with its Tamil language capabilities, holds great potential to boost the performance of new solutions,” Teo continued. “We are particularly eager to contribute to the testing and refinement of the SEA-LION models for Tamil and other Southeast Asian languages, while also sharing our expertise and best practices in LLM development.
“We look forward to seeing how this collaboration will drive innovation in multilingual AI technologies.”

Fears that AI will lead to mass job losses are unfounded, according to a new whitepaper. The report, released by British AI software firm Automated Analytics, found that none of its 5,000 clients across the UK and US reported laying off staff as a result of AI implementation. 
The whitepaper, titled “Unlocking Data, Unlocking People: Harnessing the Power of AI to Transform Your Business,” launched today at Scale Space White City in London’s White City Innovation District. It argues that AI can actually be a catalyst for growth, rather than a threat to jobs.
Despite evidence to the contrary, the study also reveals a lingering fear of AI among UK business leaders. 
A YouGov survey commissioned by Automated Analytics found that over half of senior decision-makers still believe AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates. Only 17% believe AI will create more jobs than it eliminates. 
This hesitancy, the report warns, could have serious consequences for the UK economy. As US firms increasingly embrace AI, British businesses risk being left behind. Mark Taylor, CEO of Automated Analytics, argues that the UK needs to shift its focus from regulation to innovation in order to remain competitive.
“AI is not about replacing jobs; it’s about enhancing productivity and creating new opportunities,” says Taylor. “Our whitepaper provides concrete examples of how AI can drive growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. The UK cannot afford to lag behind in this critical area.”
The whitepaper highlights several case studies demonstrating the positive impact of AI on businesses:
British Gas’ Dyno-Rod: AI helped to halve the number of service calls by improving understanding of customer journeys, providing franchise operations with 100% visibility.
Pizza Hut (US): Restaurant Management Group, the fourth-largest US franchisee, used AI to reduce recruitment costs by $1 million and increase hires by 42%.
Fourth (UK): The hospitality recruitment firm saw a 220% increase in candidate flow and a drastic reduction in cost-per-application within 30 days of implementing its AI-driven TalentTrack software.
Taylor also expressed concern over the cultural differences between the US and UK in embracing new technologies. 
“The US is leading the charge in AI adoption, while the UK remains overly focused on regulation. This whitepaper demonstrates that many fears surrounding AI are unfounded and that it can play a crucial role in driving the UK’s economic growth.”
The whitepaper serves as a call to action for UK businesses to embrace AI as a vital tool for driving innovation and competitiveness in the global market. While it’s clear that businesses must adopt AI responsibly, the whitepaper should help to dispel fears of mass job losses.

2024-09-11 22:11:52: task=Research Report: Whitepaper Dispels Fears of AI-Induced Job Losses

Introduction:
The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns about its potential impact on employment. A recent whitepaper by Automated Analytics, a British AI software firm, sets out to dispel these fears by presenting evidence that AI can actually drive growth and create new opportunities, rather than replacing human jobs.

Methodology:
The whitepaper is based on a study of 5,000 clients across the UK and US, as well as a YouGov survey commissioned by Automated Analytics. The study aimed to investigate the impact of AI on job losses and the perceptions of business leaders regarding AI adoption.

Key Findings:

1. **No job losses reported**: None of the 5,000 clients surveyed reported laying off staff as a result of AI implementation.
2. **Fear of AI among business leaders**: Despite the evidence, over half of senior decision-makers still believe AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates, with only 17% believing AI will create more jobs than it eliminates.
3. **Case studies demonstrate positive impact**: The whitepaper highlights several case studies demonstrating the positive impact of AI on businesses, including:
	* British Gas' Dyno-Rod, which used AI to improve customer journeys and reduce service calls by half.
	* Pizza Hut (US), which used AI to reduce recruitment costs by $1 million and increase hires by 42%.
	* Fourth (UK), which saw a 220% increase in candidate flow and a drastic reduction in cost-per-application within 30 days of implementing its AI-driven TalentTrack software.

Discussion:
The study's findings suggest that AI can be a catalyst for growth, rather than a threat to jobs. The fear of AI among business leaders, however, may hinder the adoption of AI and potentially lead to the UK economy being left behind in the global market.

Conclusion:
The whitepaper serves as a call to action for UK businesses to embrace AI as a vital tool for driving innovation and competitiveness. While it is essential to adopt AI responsibly, the study's findings demonstrate that many fears surrounding AI are unfounded, and AI can play a crucial role in driving the UK's economic growth.

Recommendations:

1. **Embrace AI adoption**: UK businesses should focus on innovation and embracing AI to remain competitive in the global market.
2. **Address misconceptions**: Efforts should be made to address the misconceptions surrounding AI and its impact on employment.
3. **Responsible AI adoption**: AI should be adopted responsibly, ensuring that its benefits are shared by all and its risks are mitigated.

Overall, the whitepaper provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about the impact of AI on employment, highlighting the potential benefits of AI adoption and the need for responsible innovation.2024-09-11 22:11:52: status=completed

She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider. Sep 12, 2024, 5:05 PM UTCShare this story Image: The VergeOpenAI is releasing a new model called o1, the first in a planned series of “reasoning” models that have been trained to answer more complex questions, faster than a human can. It’s being released alongside o1-mini, a smaller, cheaper version. And yes, if you’re steeped in AI rumors: this is, in fact, the extremely hyped Strawberry model.For OpenAI, o1 represents a step toward its broader goal of human-like artificial intelligence. More practically, it does a better job at writing code and solving multistep problems than previous models. But it’s also more expensive and slower to use than GPT-4o. OpenAI is calling this release of o1 a “preview” to emphasize how nascent it is.ChatGPT Plus and Team users get access to both o1-preview and o1-mini starting today, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all the free users of ChatGPT but hasn’t set a release date yet. Developer access to o1 is really expensive: In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens, or chunks of text parsed by the model, and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For comparison, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens.The training behind o1 is fundamentally different from its predecessors, OpenAI’s research lead, Jerry Tworek, tells me, though the company is being vague about the exact details. He says o1 “has been trained using a completely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it.” Image: OpenAIOpenAI taught previous GPT models to mimic patterns from its training data. With o1, it trained the model to solve problems on its own using a technique known as reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. It then uses a “chain of thought” to process queries, similarly to how humans process problems by going through them step-by-step.As a result of this new training methodology, OpenAI says the model should be more accurate. “We have noticed that this model hallucinates less,” Tworek says. But the problem still persists. “We can’t say we solved hallucinations.”The main thing that sets this new model apart from GPT-4o is its ability to tackle complex problems, such as coding and math, much better than its predecessors while also explaining its reasoning, according to OpenAI.“The model is definitely better at solving the AP math test than I am, and I was a math minor in college,” OpenAI’s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, tells me. He says OpenAI also tested o1 against a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, and while GPT-4o only correctly solved only 13 percent of problems, o1 scored 83 percent.“We can’t say we solved hallucinations”In online programming contests known as Codeforces competitions, this new model reached the 89th percentile of participants, and OpenAI claims the next update of this model will perform “similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry and biology.”At the same time, o1 is not as capable as GPT-4o in a lot of areas. It doesn’t do as well on factual knowledge about the world. It also doesn’t have the ability to browse the web or process files and images. Still, the company believes it represents a brand-new class of capabilities. It was named o1 to indicate “resetting the counter back to 1.”“I’m gonna be honest: I think we’re terrible at naming, traditionally,” McGrew says. “So I hope this is the first step of newer, more sane names that better convey what we’re doing to the rest of the world.”I wasn’t able to demo o1 myself, but McGrew and Tworek showed it to me over a video call this week. They asked it to solve this puzzle: “A princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is twice as old as the prince was when the princess’s age was half the sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and princess? Provide all solutions to that question.”The model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a correct answer. OpenAI has designed the interface to show the reasoning steps as the model thinks. What’s striking to me isn’t that it showed its work — GPT-4o can do that if prompted — but how deliberately o1 appeared to mimic human-like thought. Phrases like “I’m curious about,” “I’m thinking through,” and “Ok, let me see” created a step-by-step illusion of thinking. But this model isn’t thinking, and it’s certainly not human. So, why design it to seem like it is?Phrases like “I’m curious about,” “I’m thinking through,” and “Ok, let me see” create a step-by-step illusion of thinking. Image: OpenAIOpenAI doesn’t believe in equating AI model thinking with human thinking, according to Tworek. But the interface is meant to show how the model spends more time processing and diving deeper into solving problems, he says. “There are ways in which it feels more human than prior models.”“I think you’ll see there are lots of ways where it feels kind of alien, but there are also ways where it feels surprisingly human,” says McGrew. The model is given a limited amount of time to process queries, so it might say something like, “Oh, I’m running out of time, let me get to an answer quickly.” Early on, during its chain of thought, it may also seem like it’s brainstorming and say something like, “I could do this or that, what should I do?”Building toward agentsLarge language models aren’t exactly that smart as they exist today. They’re essentially just predicting sequences of words to get you an answer based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data. Take ChatGPT, which tends to mistakenly claim that the word “strawberry” has only two Rs because it doesn’t break down the word correctly. For what it’s worth, the new o1 model did get that query correct.As OpenAI reportedly looks to raise more funding at an eye-popping $150 billion valuation, its momentum depends on more research breakthroughs. The company is bringing reasoning capabilities to LLMs because it sees a future with autonomous systems, or agents, that are capable of making decisions and taking actions on your behalf. For AI researchers, cracking reasoning is an important next step toward human-level intelligence. The thinking is that, if a model is capable of more than pattern recognition, it could unlock breakthroughs in areas like medicine and engineering. For now, though, o1’s reasoning abilities are relatively slow, not agent-like, and expensive for developers to use.“We have been spending many months working on reasoning because we think this is actually the critical breakthrough,” McGrew says. “Fundamentally, this is a new modality for models in order to be able to solve the really hard problems that it takes in order to progress towards human-like levels of intelligence.”CommentsMost PopularMost PopularThe entire staff of beloved game publisher Annapurna Interactive has reportedly resignedOpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‘reasoning’ abilitiesThe US finally takes aim at truck bloatiFixit made its own USB-C soldering iron, and it’s already a joyPhone sex hotline accidentally featured in 'The Last of Us'Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

"AI’s role in helping to prevent skin cancer through behaviour change

About the Author

Dr Anne Lepetit is Chief Medical Officer of Bupa, a global healthcare company with more than 50 million customers worldwide and 80,000 employees. 
Anne has more than 25 years' experience in crisis management, emergency medical assistance and health insurance. She worked as an emergency department doctor for more than a decade and spent six years as an evacuation doctor.
Anne’s previous positions include Chief Medical Officer at Cigna Healthcare, Allianz, Henner and Europe Assistance.

In the past year, we’ve seen remarkable achievements across AI-assisted cancer diagnosis as more and more clinicians test, use and integrate AI companions into daily practice.
Skin cancer is no exception, and we expect AI diagnostic tools to be widely implemented across this clinical arena in the future. What does AI assistance look like for skin cancer? A 2024 study led by researchers at Stanford Medicine compared the performance of clinicians diagnosing at least one skin cancer with and without deep learning-based AI assistance. In an experimental environment, clinicians without AI assistance achieved an average sensitivity of 74.8% while for AI-assisted clinicians, sensitivity was around 81.1%.
What’s intriguing is AI helped medical professionals at all levels, with the largest improvement seen among non-dermatologists.

AI for skin cancer can impact behaviour change
Cancer is on the rise among younger people. According to a study published in BMJ Oncology, the number of under-50s worldwide being diagnosed with cancer has risen by nearly 80% in three decades. And, over the last decade melanoma skin cancer incidence rates have increased by almost two-fifths (38%) with Spain seeing a steady incidence increase of 2.4% during this time.
If detected early enough, skin cancer is easily treated and prognosis is very good. But busy lives and competing concerns mean fewer people are getting checked out, resulting in delays to diagnosis and treatment, which is dramatically changing the survival rates. Those who do, often wait to speak to a doctor. In fact, new research from Bupa, Attitudes Towards Digital Healthcare, indicates only 9% of people would immediately go to get a mole they were concerned about examined by a professional.
However, the same research found that if people were able to have a mole assessed by an AI-powered phone app at the time of their choosing, that percentage increases more than threefold (33%). This signifies emerging technology can have a significant impact on positive behaviour change in healthcare and improve clinical outcome of a potentially severe disease.

Bupa now offer an at-home dermatology tool
At Bupa, we see lots of opportunities to use AI and are exploring its use to enhance patient care, improve operational efficiency, and help our customers to live longer, healthier and happier lives. We know that people want their healthcare partner to be by their side, not just when they are sick, but supporting them constantly to keep them well.
That’s why we launched Blua, our digital healthcare service that’s available in over 200 countries. Blua provides access to three lifechanging healthcare innovations that drive convenience and accessibility. They are virtual consultations so that a customer can connect to a health professional from wherever they choose. Digital health programmesthat allow customers to proactively manage their health and remote healthcare services such as prescription delivery and at home monitoring equipment.  
For customers in Spain, we offer an at-home dermatology assessment service through Blua. How does this work? Customers who’re worried about a skin lesion can take high resolution photos of it using their smartphone. Once taken, the photos are uploaded to Blua and using AI are compared with a database of millions of other images of skin lesions to check for signs of malignancy.
The tool’s algorithms are able to discern between 302 different skin pathologies. If the tool suspects that there is a cause for concern it will let the customer know to book a follow up appointment with a doctor so that it can be looked at further and preventative action can be taken if needed.
The future of healthcare means early detection
Digital healthcare, together with AI, is going to play a crucial role in removing the barriers that stop people from getting health concerns like moles checked out in a timely manner, promoting positive behaviour change that can save lives. This is why Blua is especially useful in today’s fast-paced world where convenience is paramount and virtual consultations and at home tests will empower individuals to prioritise their health, without the need to sacrifice their time.

Initial funding for World Labs was led jointly by Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates and Radical Ventures. Other investors included AMD Ventures, Intel Capital and Nvidia's NVentures. World Labs declined to share its valuation. Li made her name in AI by developing ImageNet, a large-scale image dataset that helped usher in a generation of computer vision technologies that could identify objects reliably for the first time.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories Reuters previously reported that Li was working in stealth mode on an AI startup that could render ideas into 3D environments. World Labs' other founders are computer vision researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner and Ben Mildenhall. While commercially available generative AI models can produce dazzling text and photo outputs, Worlds Labs focuses on "spatial intelligence," or the ability to reason how the 3D world works, Li told Reuters. Spatial intelligence models could be used in the future for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) or robotics, she said. "The images and videos that you have seen so far coming out of generative AI models do not give you enough of the whole sense of how a 3D world is built," Li said in an interview, along with Mildenhall. This sense is fundamental to unlocking broader reasoning capabilities in AI systems, she noted. This would avoid the rendering of "hallucinations" like hands with the wrong number of fingers. "The way we understand the structure of the world, imagined or real, will fundamentally be a piece of this AI puzzle," Li said. The San Francisco-based startup, with 20 employees, will train foundation models that its founders refer to as "large world models" or "LWMs." Li said a combination of synthetic and real-world data will be used to train the models. The models will use the same transformer-based architecture that serves as the basis for OpenAI's viral ChatGPT chatbot, Li said. However, the transformer would not be the "be-all and end-all" of their models, she said, suggesting they will incorporate other elements as well. Li will continue her work at Stanford University's Human-Centered AI Institute while building the startup. World Labs is Li's second go-around in entrepreneurship. As a Princeton University student, Li borrowed money to buy a dry cleaning business for her parents and spent her weekends working there, she said in her memoirs.

Taylor Swift performs in Glendale, Ariz., on March 17, 2023. Kevin Winter / Getty Images file Aug. 19, 2024, 7:02 PM UTCBy Kat TenbargeOn Sunday night, Donald Trump shared a series of images on Truth Social appearing to show Taylor Swift fans wearing T-shirts that read “Swifties for Trump.” Among the images was a mock “Uncle Sam” poster with Swift’s face that said, “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.” Trump wrote: “I accept!” While two of the images Trump shared feature a real woman who supports Trump, most of the women depicted there aren’t real. At least 15 of them are representations of people created using artificial intelligence.The images Trump shared had originally been posted on X by highly followed pro-Trump accounts. One of those accounts also posted multiple guides to using generative AI tools on its Substack blog. In a reply on X, the same account acknowledged that the images Trump reposted from them were AI-generated. The new images are part of a social media campaign that some pro-Trump accounts spearheaded over the weekend trying to suggest that more and more fans of Swift, who endorsed Biden and harshly criticized Trump in 2020, are turning to support Trump. In reality, there is little evidence this is the case for a notable number of Swift’s fans, who are called “Swifties.”“There is no Swifties For Trump movement — but there should be,” wrote one of the accounts that Trump reposted on Truth Social in a caption on the AI-generated images.Other pro-Trump accounts have also shared AI-generated images that falsely depict Democrat-leaning voter blocs, like Black voters, supporting Trump. Two of the images Trump shared on Sunday were of real people and featured a Liberty University college student who had a political communications internship this summer, according to her LinkedIn account. Her “Swifties for Trump” social media content flew under the radar with fewer than 1,000 views until large pro-Trump accounts, and then Trump himself, shared it. The same pro-Trump accounts have also reshared TikToks from women who say they are Swift fans and are voting for Trump, in an effort to promote the idea that Swifties are mobilizing en masse to support Trump. But these videos received far fewer views on TikTok than they did when Trump and his highly followed supporters reshared them.Representatives for Trump’s campaign and Swift didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Swift has yet to endorse any candidate in 2024, but some of her fans have mobilized to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he was not running for re-election in July, a group called “Swifties for Kamala” launched on social media. It has more than 61,000 followers on X and is not affiliated with the singer or Harris.“We do not represent every Swiftie, but I think there is a reason we don’t need AI to show our support for Kamala,” the organization’s co-founder, Irene Kim, told NBC News in a statement. AI-generated images and videos of Swift have repeatedly gone viral this year, from sexually suggestive ones that broke X’s platform guidelines to other ones that falsely identified Swift as a Trump supporter. Throughout his presidential term and his campaigns, Trump has repeatedly shared inflammatory memes created by his  online supporters. Up until 2021 he shared them on Twitter, but after he was banned from the platform that year, he has shared them on his own Twitter copycat platform, Truth Social. Trump has since returned to posting on X, with an uptick starting Aug. 12, the day he was interviewed by Elon Musk on the platform. Over the weekend, Trump posted a fake image of Harris standing in front of a communist symbol on both X and Truth Social. It’s not yet clear if the Sunday post or the images violate certain laws around publicity, likeness and AI. In March, Swift’s home state of Tennessee passed updated legislation to protect the unauthorized use of someone’s likeness with AI. While the account that acknowledged the photos were AI-generated labeled them as satire, the account that first published the “Uncle Sam” poster using Swift’s likeness did not. David Greene, the civil liberties director and senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told NBC News that this situation, which is not exclusive to AI-generated content,  could overlap with publicity laws that protect people from unauthorized commercial use of their likenesses.“This is probably a stronger case than many others because false endorsement is at the heart of those claims, though we typically see that in terms of product endorsements,” Greene wrote in an email. “This was just good old low-tech lying.”Kat TenbargeKat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo]2024-09-16 19:55:06: status=completed

However, most of the women depicted in the images are not real, but rather representations created using artificial intelligence.

**Use of Artificial Intelligence**

The use of AI-generated images in this incident raises concerns about the authenticity of online content. The AI-generated images were created using generative AI tools, which were acknowledged by the account that originally posted them. This highlights the ease with which AI can be used to create fake content that can be spread quickly on social media.

**Implications on Publicity Laws**

The use of AI-generated images of Taylor Swift without her consent raises questions about publicity laws and the unauthorized use of someone's likeness. In March, Swift's home state of Tennessee passed updated legislation to protect the unauthorized use of someone's likeness with AI. This incident may violate these laws, and experts argue that it could overlap with publicity laws that protect people from unauthorized commercial use of their likenesses.

**Social Media Campaigns**

This incident is part of a larger social media campaign by pro-Trump accounts to suggest that Taylor Swift fans are turning to support Trump. However, there is little evidence to support this claim. The campaign has been promoted through the sharing of AI-generated images and videos, as well as TikToks from women who claim to be Swift fans and are voting for Trump.

**Conclusion**

This report highlights the importance of verifying the authenticity of online content, particularly in the context of political campaigns. The use of AI-generated images can have serious implications for publicity laws and can be used to spread misinformation. As social media continues to play a significant role in shaping public opinion, it is essential to be aware of the potential risks and consequences of AI-generated content.

**Recommendations**

1. Social media platforms should implement stricter policies to detect and remove AI-generated content that violates publicity laws.
2. Political campaigns should prioritize the use of authentic and verified content to avoid spreading misinformation.
3. Further research is needed to understand the implications of AI-generated content on social media and its impact on public opinion.2024-09-16 19:55:50: status=completed

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Sep 12, 2024, 3:04 PM UTCShare this story Illustration by Nick Barclay / The VergeMeta has acknowledged that all text and photos that adult Facebook and Instagram users have publicly published since 2007 have been fed into its artificial intelligence models. Australia’s ABC News reports that Meta’s global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, initially rejected claims about user data from 2007 being leveraged for AI training during a local government inquiry about AI adoption before relenting after additional questioning.“The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007 unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private,” Green Party senator David Shoebridge pushed in the inquiry. “That’s the reality, isn’t it?”“Correct,” Claybaugh responded.Meta’s privacy center and blog posts acknowledge hoovering up public posts and comments from Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI:We use public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI models for these features and for the open source community.We don’t use posts or comments with an audience other than Public for these purposes.But the company has been vague about how data is used, when it started scraping, and how far back its collection goes. Asked by The New York Times in June, Meta didn’t answer, other than to confirm that setting posts to anything besides “public” will prevent future scraping. That still won’t delete data that has already been collected — and people posting back in 2007 (who may have been minors at the time) wouldn’t have known their photos and posts would be used in this way.RelatedMeta’s future is AI, AI, and more AIHow to keep your images out of AI generatorsClaybaugh said that Meta doesn’t scrape data from users who are under the age of 18. When Labor Party senator Tony Sheldon asked if Meta would scrape the public photos of his children on his own account, Claybaugh confirmed it would and was unable to clarify if the company also scraped adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child.European users can opt out due to local privacy regulations, and Meta was recently banned from using Brazilian personal data for AI training, but the billions of Facebook and Instagram users in other regions can’t opt out if they want to keep their posts public. Claybaugh was unable to say if Australian users (or anyone else) would be given a choice to opt out in the future, arguing that the option was given to European users because of uncertainty regarding its regulatory landscape.“Meta made it clear today that if Australia had these same laws Australians’ data would also have been protected,” Shoebridge said to ABC News. “The government’s failure to act on privacy means companies like Meta are continuing to monetize and exploit pictures and videos of children on Facebook.”CommentsMost PopularMost PopularThe great Evernote rebootThe best Android phone to buy in 2023Apple will charge more to swap your iPhone 16 Pro batteryThe fanciest game console you can buyShogun Showdown makes you feel like a genius by showing you the futureVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

2024-09-16 20:12:06: task=**Research Report: Meta's AI Training on Publicly Posted Data since 2007**

**Introduction**

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has acknowledged that it has been feeding its artificial intelligence (AI) models with publicly posted data from its platforms since 2007. This revelation has raised concerns about privacy and the lack of opt-out options for users outside the European Union.

**Background**

In a recent government inquiry, Meta's global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, confirmed that the company has been using publicly posted text and photos from Facebook and Instagram since 2007 to train its AI models. This data is used to develop generative AI features and is also shared with the open-source community.

**Scope of Data Collection**

The data collection is not limited to recent posts, but rather encompasses all publicly posted content since 2007. This means that users who posted content on Facebook or Instagram as minors may not have been aware that their data would be used for AI training. Furthermore, users who set their posts to "public" have no option to opt-out of AI training, unless they are in the European Union, where local privacy regulations provide a opt-out mechanism.

**Data Protection for Minors**

While Meta does not scrape data from users under the age of 18, it is unclear whether the company also scrapes adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the protection of minors' data.

**Regional Variations in Data Protection**

European users are protected by local privacy regulations and can opt-out of AI training. In contrast, users in other regions, including Australia, do not have this option. Meta was recently banned from using Brazilian personal data for AI training, highlighting the varying levels of data protection across regions.

**Implications and Concerns**

The revelation of Meta's AI training practices has significant implications for user privacy and data protection. The lack of transparency and opt-out options for users outside the EU raises concerns about the exploitation of user data. Furthermore, the use of publicly posted data for AI training without explicit consent from users may violate ethical standards.

**Conclusion**

Meta's practice of feeding its AI models with publicly posted data since 2007 raises important questions about user privacy, data protection, and ethical AI development. The lack of transparency and opt-out options for users outside the EU is a significant concern that needs to be addressed. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is essential to establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure that user data is protected and used ethically.2024-09-16 20:12:06: status=completed

AI and bots allegedly used to fraudulently boost music streams

As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
A singer from the United States has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently inflate his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties.
Michael Smith, 52, from North Carolina, faces charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.
According to the BBC, authorities allege that this is the first time AI has been used to allow such a large-scale streaming scam. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasised the scope of the fraud, claiming that Smith took millions of dollars in royalties that should have gone to real musicians, songwriters and rights holders.
The accusations stem from an unsealed indictment alleging that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms. To avoid detection, automated bots streamed the tracks—sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.
The FBI played a crucial role in the investigation. The agency’s acting assistant director, Christie M. Curtis, explained that the agency was dedicated to tracking down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings while simultaneously undermining the efforts of real artists.
According to the indictment, Smith began working with the CEO of an undisclosed AI music firm around 2018. This co-conspirator allegedly provided Smith with thousands of AI-generated tracks each month. In exchange, Smith offered metadata such as song titles and artist names, and offered a share of streaming earnings.
One email exchange between Smith and the unnamed CEO in March 2019 demonstrates how the plot took shape. The executive stated, “Keep in mind what we’re doing musically here…this is not ‘music,’ [but] ‘instant music’).” The email emphasises the operation’s intentional nature, as well as the use of AI to generate large amounts of content with minimal effort. According to the indictment, the technology improved over time, making it harder for streaming platforms to detect fraudulent streams.
In another email dated February, Smith boasted that his AI-generated tracks had accumulated over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019. If convicted, Smith faces significant prison time for the charges brought against him.
The Smith case is not the only one involving bogus music streaming royalties. Earlier this year, a Danish man received an 18-month term for a similar plan. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube forbid bots and artificial streams from being used to boost royalties. Such behaviour is disruptive and illegal, and platforms have taken steps to combat it through policy changes. For instance, if artificial streams are detected, Spotify charges the label or distributor and music can earn royalties only if it meets certain criteria.
Nevertheless, the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry. Musicians and record companies fear they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text and images. Such tools reportedly sometimes use content that musicians and other creators have posted on the internet, raising questions about copyright infringement.
Tension came to a head in 2023 when a track that mimicked the voices of popular artists Drake and The Weeknd went viral, prompting streaming platforms to remove it. Earlier this year, several high-profile musicians, including Billie Eilish, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith, signed an open letter urging the music industry to address the “predatory” use of AI to generate content.

2024-09-18 21:03:32: task=**Research Report: AI and Bots Allegedly Used to Fraudulently Boost Music Streams**

**Introduction**

The music industry has been plagued by fraudulent activities, with the latest scam involving the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and bots to artificially inflate music streams and earn millions of dollars in royalties. This report summarizes the key insights and information on this topic, highlighting the alleged fraudulent activities, the impact on the music industry, and the efforts to combat this issue.

**The Alleged Fraudulent Activities**

According to an unsealed indictment, Michael Smith, a 52-year-old singer from North Carolina, has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently boost his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties. The indictment alleges that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms, using automated bots to stream the tracks, sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.

**The Role of AI in Music Fraud**

The use of AI in music fraud is a growing concern, as it enables the creation of large amounts of content with minimal effort. In this case, AI-generated tracks were used to create "instant music" that was designed to deceive music streaming platforms and earn fraudulent royalties. The technology improved over time, making it harder for streaming platforms to detect fraudulent streams.

**Impact on the Music Industry**

The fraudulent activities have significant implications for the music industry, as they undermine the efforts of real artists and songwriters. The alleged fraud has resulted in millions of dollars in lost royalties, which could have gone to legitimate artists and creators. Moreover, the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry, with musicians and record companies fearing they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text, and images.

**Efforts to Combat Music Fraud**

Music streaming platforms have taken steps to combat music fraud, including policy changes to detect and prevent artificial streams. For instance, Spotify charges the label or distributor and music can earn royalties only if it meets certain criteria. Law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, are also working to track down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings.

**Conclusion**

The alleged fraudulent activities involving AI and bots to boost music streams highlight the need for increased vigilance and action to combat music fraud. The music industry must work together to address the "predatory" use of AI to generate content and ensure that royalties are paid to legitimate artists and creators. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the issue, highlighting the key insights and information on AI and bots allegedly used to fraudulently boost music streams.2024-09-18 21:03:32: status=completed

2024-09-18 21:06:14: task=Research Report: AI and Bots Allegedly Used to Fraudulently Boost Music Streams

Introduction:
The music industry has been plagued by fraudulent activities, with AI and bots being used to artificially inflate music streams and earn millions of dollars in royalties. This report summarizes the key insights from recent news articles on this topic, highlighting the allegations, investigations, and consequences of such activities.

Background:
According to a recent article, a singer from the United States, Michael Smith, has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently inflate his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties. This is allegedly the first time AI has been used to allow such a large-scale streaming scam.

Allegations:
The accusations stem from an unsealed indictment alleging that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms. To avoid detection, automated bots streamed the tracks, sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.

Investigation:
The FBI played a crucial role in the investigation, working with the CEO of an undisclosed AI music firm to uncover the scheme. The agency's acting assistant director, Christie M. Curtis, emphasized the dedication to tracking down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings while simultaneously undermining the efforts of real artists.

Consequences:
If convicted, Smith faces significant prison time for the charges brought against him. This case is not an isolated incident, as earlier this year, a Danish man received an 18-month term for a similar plan. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube have policies in place to combat such fraudulent activities, but the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry.

Industry Impact:
The use of AI-generated music and bots to fraudulently boost music streams has significant implications for the music industry. Musicians and record companies fear they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text, and images. The industry is urging policymakers to address the "predatory" use of AI to generate content.

Recommendations:
To combat fraudulent activities in the music industry, it is essential to:

1. Implement robust policies and detection mechanisms to identify and prevent AI-generated music and bot-driven streams.

AI and bots allegedly used to fraudulently boost music streams

As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
A singer from the United States has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently inflate his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties.
Michael Smith, 52, from North Carolina, faces charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.
According to the BBC, authorities allege that this is the first time AI has been used to allow such a large-scale streaming scam. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasised the scope of the fraud, claiming that Smith took millions of dollars in royalties that should have gone to real musicians, songwriters and rights holders.
The accusations stem from an unsealed indictment alleging that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms. To avoid detection, automated bots streamed the tracks—sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.
The FBI played a crucial role in the investigation. The agency’s acting assistant director, Christie M. Curtis, explained that the agency was dedicated to tracking down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings while simultaneously undermining the efforts of real artists.
According to the indictment, Smith began working with the CEO of an undisclosed AI music firm around 2018. This co-conspirator allegedly provided Smith with thousands of AI-generated tracks each month. In exchange, Smith offered metadata such as song titles and artist names, and offered a share of streaming earnings.
One email exchange between Smith and the unnamed CEO in March 2019 demonstrates how the plot took shape. The executive stated, “Keep in mind what we’re doing musically here…this is not ‘music,’ [but] ‘instant music’).” The email emphasises the operation’s intentional nature, as well as the use of AI to generate large amounts of content with minimal effort. According to the indictment, the technology improved over time, making it harder for streaming platforms to detect fraudulent streams.
In another email dated February, Smith boasted that his AI-generated tracks had accumulated over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019. If convicted, Smith faces significant prison time for the charges brought against him.
The Smith case is not the only one involving bogus music streaming royalties. Earlier this year, a Danish man received an 18-month term for a similar plan. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube forbid bots and artificial streams from being used to boost royalties. Such behaviour is disruptive and illegal, and platforms have taken steps to combat it through policy changes. For instance, if artificial streams are detected, Spotify charges the label or distributor and music can earn royalties only if it meets certain criteria.
Nevertheless, the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry. Musicians and record companies fear they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text and images. Such tools reportedly sometimes use content that musicians and other creators have posted on the internet, raising questions about copyright infringement.
Tension came to a head in 2023 when a track that mimicked the voices of popular artists Drake and The Weeknd went viral, prompting streaming platforms to remove it. Earlier this year, several high-profile musicians, including Billie Eilish, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith, signed an open letter urging the music industry to address the “predatory” use of AI to generate content.

SolarWinds: IT professionals want stronger AI regulation

A new survey from SolarWinds has unveiled a resounding call for increased government oversight of AI, with 88% of IT professionals advocating for stronger regulation.
The study, which polled nearly 700 IT experts, highlights security as the paramount concern. An overwhelming 72% of respondents emphasised the critical need for measures to secure infrastructure. Privacy follows closely behind, with 64% of IT professionals urging for more robust rules to protect sensitive information.
Rob Johnson, VP and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at SolarWinds, commented: “It is understandable that IT leaders are approaching AI with caution. As technology rapidly evolves, it naturally presents challenges typical of any emerging innovation.
“Security and privacy remain at the forefront, with ongoing scrutiny by regulatory bodies. However, it is incumbent upon organisations to take proactive measures by enhancing data hygiene, enforcing robust AI ethics and assembling the right teams to lead these efforts. This proactive stance not only helps with compliance with evolving regulations but also maximises the potential of AI.”
The survey’s findings come at a pivotal moment, coinciding with the implementation of the EU’s AI Act. In the UK, the new Labour government recently proposed its own AI legislation during the latest King’s speech, signalling a growing recognition of the need for regulatory frameworks. In the US, the California State Assembly passed a controversial AI safety bill last month.
Beyond security and privacy, the survey reveals a broader spectrum of concerns amongst IT professionals. A majority (55%) believe government intervention is crucial to stem the tide of AI-generated misinformation. Additionally, half of the respondents support regulations aimed at ensuring transparency and ethical practices in AI development.
Challenges extend beyond AI regulation
However, the challenges facing AI adoption extend beyond regulatory concerns. The survey uncovers a troubling lack of trust in data quality—a cornerstone of successful AI implementation.
Only 38% of respondents consider themselves ‘very trusting’ of the data quality and training used in AI systems. This scepticism is not unfounded, as 40% of IT leaders who have encountered issues with AI attribute these problems to algorithmic errors stemming from insufficient or biased data.
Consequently, data quality emerges as the second most significant barrier to AI adoption (16%), trailing only behind security and privacy risks. This finding underscores the critical importance of robust, unbiased datasets in driving AI success.
“High-quality data is the cornerstone of accurate and reliable AI models, which in turn drive better decision-making and outcomes,” adds Johnson. “Trustworthy data builds confidence in AI among IT professionals, accelerating the broader adoption and integration of AI technologies.”
The survey also sheds light on widespread concerns about database readiness. Less than half (43%) of IT professionals express confidence in their company’s ability to meet the increasing data demands of AI. This lack of preparedness is further exacerbated by the perception that organisations are not moving swiftly enough to implement AI, with 46% of respondents citing ongoing data quality challenges as a contributing factor.
As AI continues to reshape the technological landscape, the findings of this SolarWinds survey serve as a clarion call for both stronger regulation and improved data practices. The message from IT professionals is clear: while AI holds immense promise, its successful integration hinges on addressing critical concerns around security, privacy, and data quality.

2024-09-19 20:03:17: task=**SolarWinds: IT Professionals Want Stronger AI Regulation**

The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has raised concerns among IT professionals about the need for stronger regulation. A recent survey by SolarWinds reveals that 88% of IT professionals advocate for increased government oversight of AI, citing security and privacy as the top concerns.

**Security and Privacy: Key Concerns**

The survey highlights that 72% of respondents emphasize the critical need for measures to secure infrastructure, while 64% urge for more robust rules to protect sensitive information. Rob Johnson, VP and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at SolarWinds, notes that organizations must take proactive measures to enhance data hygiene, enforce robust AI ethics, and assemble the right teams to lead these efforts.

**Broader Spectrum of Concerns**

Beyond security and privacy, the survey reveals that 55% of IT professionals believe government intervention is crucial to stem the tide of AI-generated misinformation. Additionally, half of the respondents support regulations aimed at ensuring transparency and ethical practices in AI development.

**Data Quality: A Critical Barrier**

The survey uncovers a troubling lack of trust in data quality, with only 38% of respondents considering themselves 'very trusting' of the data quality and training used in AI systems. This skepticism is not unfounded, as 40% of IT leaders who have encountered issues with AI attribute these problems to algorithmic errors stemming from insufficient or biased data.

**Database Readiness: A Concern**

Less than half (43%) of IT professionals express confidence in their company's ability to meet the increasing data demands of AI. This lack of preparedness is further exacerbated by the perception that organizations are not moving swiftly enough to implement AI, with 46% of respondents citing ongoing data quality challenges as a contributing factor.

**Conclusion**

The findings of this SolarWinds survey serve as a clarion call for both stronger regulation and improved data practices. IT professionals are urging for increased government oversight of AI, while also emphasizing the need for organizations to take proactive measures to address critical concerns around security, privacy, and data quality. As AI continues to reshape the technological landscape, it is essential to address these concerns to ensure the successful integration of AI technologies.2024-09-19 20:03:17: status=completed

Tech industry giants urge EU to streamline AI regulations

 Ryan Daws is a senior editor at TechForge Media with over a decade of experience in crafting compelling narratives and making complex topics accessible. His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance.

Meta has spearheaded an open letter calling for urgent reform of AI regulations in the EU. The letter, which garnered support from over 50 prominent companies – including Ericsson, SAP, and Spotify – was published as an advert in the Financial Times.
The collective voice of these industry leaders highlights a pressing issue: Europe’s bureaucratic approach to AI regulation may be stifling innovation and causing the region to lag behind its global counterparts.
“Europe has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions and it now risks falling further behind in the AI era due to inconsistent regulatory decision making,” the letter states, painting a stark picture of the continent’s current position in the AI race.
The signatories emphasise two key areas of concern. Firstly, they point to the development of ‘open’ models, which are freely available for use, modification, and further development. These models are lauded for their potential to “multiply the benefits and spread social and economic opportunity” while simultaneously bolstering sovereignty and control.
Secondly, the letter underscores the importance of ‘multimodal’ models, which integrate text, images, and speech capabilities. The signatories argue that the leap from text-only to multimodal models is akin to “the difference between having only one sense and having all five of them”. They assert that these advanced models could significantly boost productivity, drive scientific research, and inject hundreds of billions of euros into the European economy.
However, the crux of the matter lies in the regulatory landscape. The letter expresses frustration with the uncertainty surrounding data usage for AI model training, stemming from interventions by European Data Protection Authorities. This ambiguity, they argue, could result in Large Language Models (LLMs) lacking crucial Europe-specific training data.
To address these challenges, the signatories call for “harmonised, consistent, quick and clear decisions under EU data regulations that enable European data to be used in AI training for the benefit of Europeans”. They stress the need for “decisive action” to unlock Europe’s potential for creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, which they believe is essential for the region’s prosperity and technological leadership.
A copy of the letter can be found below:
While the letter acknowledges the importance of consumer protection, it also highlights the delicate balance regulators must strike to avoid hindering commercial progress. The European Commission’s approach to regulation has often been criticised for its perceived heavy-handedness, and this latest appeal from industry leaders adds weight to growing concerns about the region’s global competitiveness in the AI sector.
The pressure is rapidly mounting on European policymakers to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while maintaining appropriate safeguards. The coming months will likely see intensified dialogue between industry stakeholders and regulators as they grapple with these complex issues that will shape the future of AI development in Europe.

2024-09-21 20:59:44: task=**Research Report: Tech Industry Giants Urge EU to Streamline AI Regulations**

**Introduction**

The European Union (EU) has been urged by tech industry giants to reform its Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulations to foster innovation and competitiveness in the region. The call to action comes from over 50 prominent companies, including Meta, Ericsson, SAP, and Spotify, who signed an open letter highlighting the need for harmonized and consistent regulatory decisions under EU data regulations.

**Key Concerns**

The signatories of the letter express two primary concerns:

1. **Open Models**: The development of open models, which are freely available for use, modification, and further development, is crucial for multiplying the benefits and spreading social and economic opportunities. These models have the potential to bolster sovereignty and control.
2. **Multimodal Models**: The leap from text-only to multimodal models, which integrate text, images, and speech capabilities, is akin to having all five senses. These advanced models can significantly boost productivity, drive scientific research, and inject hundreds of billions of euros into the European economy.

**Regulatory Landscape**

The signatories emphasize the need for harmonized, consistent, quick, and clear decisions under EU data regulations that enable European data to be used in AI training for the benefit of Europeans. The current uncertainty surrounding data usage for AI model training, stemming from interventions by European Data Protection Authorities, could result in Large Language Models (LLMs) lacking crucial Europe-specific training data.

**Call to Action**

The industry leaders urge the European Commission to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while maintaining appropriate safeguards. They stress the need for decisive action to unlock Europe's potential for creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, which is essential for the region's prosperity and technological leadership.

**Conclusion**

The EU's approach to AI regulation has often been criticized for its perceived heavy-handedness, and this latest appeal from industry leaders adds weight to growing concerns about the region's global competitiveness in the AI sector. The pressure is mounting on European policymakers to create a regulatory environment that balances innovation with consumer protection. The coming months will likely see intensified dialogue between industry stakeholders and regulators as they grapple with these complex issues that will shape the future of AI development in Europe.

**Recommendations**

Based on the research, the following recommendations can be made:

1. The European Commission should establish a harmonized and consistent regulatory framework for AI development, ensuring that European data can be used in AI training for the benefit of Europeans.
2. Industry stakeholders and regulators should engage in intensified dialogue to address the complex issues surrounding AI regulation, balancing innovation with consumer protection.
3. The EU should invest in research and development of open and multimodal AI models, which can drive economic growth, boost productivity, and enhance competitiveness.

By adopting these recommendations, the EU can create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation, drives economic growth, and maintains appropriate safeguards for consumers.2024-09-21 20:59:44: status=completed

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs described the computer as a bicycle for the mind. What the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship just launched has a bit more horsepower.“Maybe it’s not a Ferrari yet, but we have a car,” says Bill Aulet, the center’s managing director. The vehicle: the MIT Entrepreneurship JetPack, a generative artificial intelligence tool trained on Aulet’s 24-step Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework to input prompts into large language models.Introduce a startup idea to the Eship JetPack, “and it’s like having five or 10 or 12 MIT undergraduates who instantaneously run out and do all the research you want based on the question you asked, and then they bring back the answer,” Aulet says.The tool is currently being used by entrepreneurship students and piloted outside MIT, and there is a waitlist that prospective users can join. The tool is accessed through the Trust Center’s Orbit digital entrepreneurship platform, which was launched for student use in 2019. Orbit grew out of a need for an alternative to the static Trust Center website, Aulet says.“We weren’t following our own protocols of entrepreneurship,” he says. “You meet the students where they are, and more and more of them were on their phones. I said, ‘Let’s build an app that’s more dynamic than a static website, and that will be the way that we can get to the students.”With the help of Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek and Product Lead Doug Williams, Orbit has become a one-stop shop for student entrepreneurs. On the platform’s back end, leaders at the center are able to see what users are and are not clicking on.Aulet and his team have been studying that user information since Orbit’s launch. It’s enabled them to learn how students want to access information, not just about course offerings or startup competition applications but also to get guidance on an idea they’re working on or connect to an entrepreneurial community of co-founders and advisers. The team also received advice from Ethan Mollick SM ’04, PhD ’10, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School and author of a new book, “Co-Intelligence: Living and Working With AI.”Official work on the Eship JetPack began about six months ago. The name was inspired by the acceleration a jet pack provides, and the need for a human to take advantage of the boost and guide its direction.“As we moved from our initial focus on capturing information to providing guidance, MIT's Disciplined Entrepreneurship and Startup Tactics frameworks were the perfect place to start,” Williams says.One of the earliest beta users, Shari Van Cleave, MBA ’15, demonstrated how to use the AI tool in a YouTube video.She submitted an experimental idea for mobile electric vehicle charging, and within seconds the AI tool suggested market segments, beachhead markets, a business model, pricing, assumptions, testing, and a product plan — and that’s only seven of the 24 steps of the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework that she explored.“I was impressed by how quickly the AI, with just a few details, generated recommendations for everything from market-sizing (TAM) to lifetime customer value models,” Van Cleave said in an email. “Having a high-quality rough draft means founders, whether new or experienced, can execute and fundraise faster.”And for those entrepreneurs who might already have an idea and be well on their way through the 24-step process, the tool can be useful for them, too, Aulet says. For example, they might want insights and quotes about how their company can improve its performance or determine whether there’s a better market to be targeting.“Our goal is to lift the field of entrepreneurship, and a tool like this would allow more people to be entrepreneurs, and be better entrepreneurs,” Aulet says.

Beam has deployed the world’s first AI-driven autonomous underwater vehicle for offshore wind farm inspections. The technology has already proved its mettle by inspecting jacket structures at Scotland’s largest offshore wind farm, Seagreen—a joint venture between SSE Renewables, TotalEnergies, and PTTEP.
The AI-powered vehicle represents a significant leap forward in marine technology and underwater robotics. Capable of conducting complex underwater inspections without human intervention, it promises to dramatically enhance efficiency and slash costs associated with underwater surveys and inspections.
Traditionally, offshore wind site inspections have been manual, labour-intensive processes. Beam’s autonomous solution offers a radical departure from this approach, enabling data to be streamed directly back to shore. This shift allows offshore workers to concentrate on more intricate tasks while reducing inspection timelines by up to 50%, resulting in substantial operational cost savings.
Brian Allen, CEO of Beam, said: “We are very proud to have succeeded in deploying the world’s first autonomous underwater vehicle driven by AI. Automation can revolutionise how we carry out inspection and maintenance of offshore wind farms, helping to reduce both costs and timelines.”
Beyond improved efficiency, Beam’s technology elevates the quality of inspection data and facilitates the creation of 3D reconstructions of assets alongside visual data. This deployment marks a crucial step in Beam’s roadmap for autonomous technology, with plans to extend this AI-driven solution across its fleet of DP2 vessels, ROVs, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) throughout 2025 and 2026.
“Looking ahead to the future, the potential of this technology is huge for the industry, and success in these initial projects is vital for us to progress and realise this vision. This wouldn’t be possible without forward-thinking customers like SSE Renewables who are willing to go on the journey with us,” explained Allen.
The Seagreen wind farm, operational since October 2023, is the world’s deepest fixed-bottom offshore wind farm. Beam’s project at Seagreen has provided crucial insights into the potential of autonomous technology for large offshore wind superstructures. The data collected by the AI-driven vehicle will support ongoing operational reliability at the site, offering valuable information on areas such as marine growth and potential erosion at the foundations.
Matthew Henderson, Technical Asset Manager – Substructure and Asset Lifecycle at SSE Renewables, commented: “At SSE, we have a mantra that ‘if it’s not safe, we don’t do it.’ Beam’s technology demonstrates that autonomous inspections can reduce the personnel we need to send offshore for planned inspections, while speeding up planned works and collecting rich data-sets to inform asset integrity planning.
“As we move further offshore, and into deeper waters, the ability to collect high-quality inspection data in a low-risk manner is imperative to us delivering our Net Zero Acceleration Programme.”
As Beam prepares to roll out its AI-driven inspection technology across its fleet in 2025 and 2026, this deployment aligns with the company’s mission to revolutionise offshore wind operations by making them more efficient and cost-effective—further supporting the global energy transition.
The success of this AI-powered underwater vehicle at Seagreen wind farm not only demonstrates the potential of autonomous technology in offshore wind inspections but also sets a new standard for safety, efficiency, and data quality in the industry. Such innovations will play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of offshore wind energy.

Staying competitive in modern sales today effectively means embracing the latest trends in tech.
Since late 2022 – when generative AI made its way to the public’s consciousness thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT – AI has been at the forefront of this shift, changing the way sales teams (like most other teams) operate and connect with clients.
In this blog post, let’s dive into how AI is streamlining sales activities and helping boost conversion rates.
Here are the top five ways sales teams can use AI to better personalise interactions, automate admin work, and more, proving that it’s not just about cutting costs but transforming how sales are done.

1. Personalised engagement
A typical sales cycle is complex, involving multiple touchpoints and interactions before conversion. Deeper personalisation involves understanding a prospect’s business needs, challenges, and industry trends. AI tools are particularly adept at sifting through large datasets to uncover insights that tailor interactions to these specific business contexts.
For instance, AI can analyse past interactions, like email exchanges and engagement history, to determine what type of content or product features are most relevant to a specific client. This allows sales teams to offer solutions that are not just generic services or products but are customised to address the client’s unique challenges and goals.
AI can enhance account-based marketing (ABM) strategies by enabling sales teams to create highly personalised content strategies for each account. By analysing data from various touchpoints in the quote to cash process, AI helps in crafting messages that resonate deeply with each decision-maker in the client’s organisation. This targeted approach not only strengthens relationships but also significantly increases the likelihood of closing deals.

2. Sales forecasting
Accurate sales forecasting is vital in B2B sales, where strategic planning and resource allocation depend heavily on predicted sales outcomes. AI significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of these forecasts by analysing vast amounts of data and identifying trends that are hard to spot.
AI-driven pipeline forecasting tools use historical sales data, market conditions, and real-time sales activity to predict future sales performance. These tools employ predictive analytics to model various scenarios and their potential impacts on sales, helping sales teams to prepare more effectively for future market movements.
Moreover, AI-enhanced forecasting tools can dynamically update predictions based on new data. This means that sales forecasts are not static but evolve as more interaction and transaction data becomes available. Such dynamic forecasting ensures that sales strategies remain agile and responsive to changes, increasing the overall efficiency of sales operations.

By leveraging AI for advanced sales forecasting, B2B companies can not only forecast with greater accuracy but also gain strategic insights that can lead to a more proactive approach in managing sales pipelines and customer relationships.

3. Dynamic pricing
Dynamic pricing is an advanced AI application that can significantly boost B2B sales performance by optimising pricing strategies based on real-time market data and customer behaviour. This technology allows companies to adjust their pricing models swiftly in response to changes in the market or customer demand, ensuring competitiveness and maximising revenue.
AI tools like Competera analyse historical sales data, market dynamics, competitor pricing, and customer patterns to recommend the most effective pricing strategies for various products and services. For instance, it can suggest special discounts for high-value clients or adjust prices during peak demand periods to capitalise on market trends.
AI-driven dynamic pricing can enhance customer satisfaction by offering fair prices that reflect the current value of the products or services, which can differ across customer segments or even individual clients based on their purchase history and loyalty.

By integrating dynamic pricing models powered by AI, sales teams not only streamline their pricing strategies but also ensure that they are adaptable, data-driven, and closely aligned with both market conditions and customer expectations.

For B2B companies aiming to refine their pricing and sales strategies, an AI consulting service is a crucial edge. By engaging advanced data analytics and AI/ML expertise, these services enhance data-driven decision-making, improve customer relationships, and accelerate sales cycles, fostering a more competitive and efficient sales process.

4. Lead scoring and prioritisation
When you have a healthy influx of leads, efficiently managing them is crucial. Sales teams can use AI to dramatically enhance this process through sophisticated lead scoring systems, which assess and rank prospects based on their likelihood to convert. This prioritisation ensures that sales teams focus their efforts on the most promising leads, optimising both time and resources.

AI tools integrate various data points like past interactions, engagement levels, company size, and industry-specific behaviours to create a comprehensive profile of each lead. AI algorithms can examine historical data to recognise patterns that indicate a high probability of conversion. This might include the frequency of communications, the types of questions asked by the prospect, or their engagement with specific content.
For example, Salesforce Einstein uses machine learning to continuously refine its scoring model based on new data, making the lead qualification process more dynamic and accurate. By automating the identification of high-potential leads, sales teams can allocate more time to crafting personalised outreach strategies that are more likely to resonate with top-tier prospects.

Moreover, AI-powered lead scoring can alert sales teams to changes in a lead’s score in real-time. This means that if a prospect’s engagement level increases due to a recent interaction or a change in their business needs, the sales team can immediately capitalise on this opportunity, increasing the chances of a successful sale.

So, by leveraging AI for lead scoring and prioritisation, sales teams can ensure they are not just reaching out to more leads, but are reaching out to the right leads at the right time.

5. Automating administrative tasks
AI’s prowess to automate administrative tasks is a game changer in B2B sales, where efficiency and time management are critical. By taking over routine tasks, AI allows sales teams to dedicate more energy and focus to engaging with clients and closing deals.

For instance, AI-powered CRM tools can handle data entry, manage email sequences, schedule meetings, and update logs with new client information. This automation streamlines the sales process, reducing the administrative burden and minimising the potential for human error.

AI-driven automation extends to crafting and sending follow-up emails. AI can analyse the interaction history with each client to determine the most effective follow-up strategy, tailoring messages based on the client’s previous responses and engagement level. This personalised approach ensures that communications are relevant and timely, thereby increasing the likelihood of maintaining the client’s interest and pushing the sales process forward.

And, AI can offer predictive insights about the best times to contact clients or send out proposals, based on data patterns that include client availability and response rates. This predictive capability ensures that sales efforts are not just systematic but also strategically timed, maximising the impact of each interaction.

By leveraging AI to automate these essential but repetitive tasks, B2B sales teams can significantly improve their productivity and effectiveness, allowing them to focus on what they do best – building relationships and closing sales.

Wrapping up
The integration of AI tools in modern sales processes brings efficiency and effectiveness, allowing sales teams to focus on strategic aspects of sales like relationship building and closing high-value deals. Teams that embrace AI can expect not only increased conversion rates but also more responsive sales ops that can adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.

All in all, companies that welcome ongoing adaptation and investment in AI tools will be well-positioned to lead in their industries, leveraging AI not just as a tool, but as a core component of their sales strategy."

 Industries,
As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
As AI applications evolve, they place greater demands on network infrastructure, particularly in terms of latency and connectivity.
Supporting large-scale AI deployments introduces new issues, and analysts predict that AI-related traffic will soon account for a major portion of total network traffic. The industry must be prepared to handle this surge effectively. F5 is adapting its solutions to manage the complexity of AI workloads, and its technology now includes real-time processing of multimodal data.

AI presents both opportunities and risks in security, as it has the capability to enhance protection while also enabling AI-driven cyber threats. Collaboration among hyperscalers, telcos, and technology companies is critical for establishing AI-optimised networks. Collaboration and innovation continue to change the AI networking landscape, and F5 is dedicated to driving progress in this area.
Ahead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Kunal Anand, Chief Technology and AI Officer at F5, discusses the company’s role and initiatives to stay at the forefront of AI-enabled networking solutions.
AI News: As AI applications evolve, the demands on network infrastructure are becoming more complex. What key challenges does the industry face regarding latency and connectivity in supporting large-scale AI deployments?

Anand: F5 discovered that AI has drastically transformed application architectures. Some companies are investing billions of dollars in AI factories – massive GPU clusters – while others prefer cloud-based solutions or small language models (SLMs) as less expensive alternatives.

Network architectures are evolving to address these challenges. AI factories operate on distinct networking stacks, like InfiniBand with specific GPUs like the H100s or NVIDIA’s upcoming Blackwell series. At the same time, cloud-based technologies and GPU clouds are advancing.

A major trend is data gravity, where organisations’ data is locked in specific environments. This has driven the evolution of multi-cloud architectures, allowing workloads to link with data across environments for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

As RAG demands rise, organisations face higher latency because of limited resources, whether from heavily used data stores or limited sets of GPU servers.

AI News: As analysts predict AI-related traffic will soon make up a significant portion of network traffic. What unique challenges does this influx of AI-generated traffic pose for existing network infrastructure, and how do you see the industry preparing for it?

Anand: F5 believes that by the end of the decade, most applications will be AI-powered or AI-driven, necessitating augmentation across the network services chain. These applications will use APIs to communicate with AI factories and third-party services, access data for RAG, and potentially expose their own APIs. Essentially, APIs will be the glue holding this ecosystem together, as analysts have suggested.

Looking ahead, AI-related traffic is expected to dominate network traffic as AI becomes increasingly integrated into applications and APIs. As AI becomes central to practically all applications, AI-related traffic will naturally increase.

AI News: With AI applications becoming more complex and processing multimodal data in real time, how is F5 adapting its solutions to ensure networks can efficiently manage these dynamic workloads?

Anand: F5 looks at this from many angles. In the case of RAG, when data – whether images, binary streams, or text – must be retrieved from a data storage, the method is the same regardless of data format. Customers often want quick Layer 4 load balancing, traffic management, and steering capabilities, all of which F5 excels at. The company provides organisations with load balancing, traffic management, and security services, guaranteeing RAG has efficient data access. F5 has also enabled load balancing among AI factories.

In some cases, large organisations manage massive GPU clusters with tens of thousands of GPUs. Since AI workloads are unpredictable, these GPUs may be available or unavailable depending on the workload. F5 ensures efficient traffic routing, mitigating the unpredictability of AI workloads.

F5 improves performance, increases throughput, and adds security capabilities for organisations building AI factories and clusters.

AI News: As AI enhances security while also posing AI-driven cyber threats, what approaches is F5 taking to strengthen network security and resilience against these evolving challenges?

Anand: There are many different AI-related challenges on the way. Attackers are already employing AI to generate new payloads, find loopholes, and launch unique attacks. For example, ChatGPT and visual transformers have the ability to break CAPTCHAs, especially interactive ones. Recent demonstrations have shown the sophistication of these attacks.

As seen in past security patterns, every time attackers gain an advantage with new technology, defenders must rise to the challenge. This often necessitates reconsidering security models, like shifting from “allow everything, deny some” to “allow some, deny everything.” Many organisations are exploring solutions to combat AI-driven threats.

F5 is making big investments to keep ahead of AI-driven threats. As part of its F5 intelligence programme, the company is developing, training, and deploying models, which are supported by its AI Center of Excellence.

Earlier this year, F5 launched an AI data fabric, with a team dedicated to developing models that serve the entire business, from policy creation to insight delivery. F5 feels it is well placed to face these rising issues.

AI News: What role do partnerships play in developing the next generation of AI-optimised networks, especially between hyperscalers, telcos, and tech companies?

Anand: Partnerships are important for AI development. The AI stack is complex and involves several components, including electricity, data centres, hardware, servers, GPUs, memory, computational power, and a networking stack, all of which must function together. It is unusual for a single organisation to oversee everything from start to finish.

F5 focuses on establishing and maintaining the necessary partnerships in computation, networking, and storage to support AI.

AI News: How does F5 view its role in advancing AI networking, and what initiatives are you focusing on to stay at the forefront of AI-enabled networking solutions?

Anand: F5 is committed to developing its technology platform. The AI Data Fabric, launched earlier this year, will work with the AI Center of Excellence to prepare the organisation for the future.

F5 is also forming strong partnerships, with announcements to come. The company is excited about its work and the rapid pace of global change. F5’s unique vantage point – processing worldwide traffic – enables it to correlate data insights with industry trends. F5 also intends to be more forthcoming about its research and models, with some open-source contributions coming soon.

Overall, F5 is incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative impact of AI is remarkable, and it is an exciting time to be part of this shift.

Healthcare documentation is an integral part of the sector that ensures the delivery of high-quality care and maintains the continuity of patient information. However, as healthcare providers have to deal with excessive amounts of data, managing it can feel overwhelming. With the advent of intelligent document processing technology, a new solution can now be implemented. This article explores how such technology works, its role in healthcare documentation, and its benefits, limitations, and implications for the future.
Intelligent document processing and its importance
Intelligent document processing is a more advanced type of automation based on AI technology, machine learning, natural language processing, and optical character recognition to collect, process, and organise data from multiple forms of paperwork. Unlike traditional document systems, IDP can handle unstructured and semi-structured data for multiple healthcare documents, which can exist in various forms. As such data is based on advanced, permanent algorithms and artificial intelligence tools, IDP can enhance the functions of healthcare providers and assist them in the care delivery process.
IDP’s role in healthcare documentation
Multiple forms of documents, like health, employment, or insurance records, reports, notes, forms, and social documents, have to be dealt with by multiple providers daily. IDP can reduce the need for inefficient data management processes through:
Automating the data extraction process by automatically capturing the essential information from the documents. Thus, it reduces the human factor and enhance performance,
Establishing more accurate data With AI algorithms. IDP ensures that the data captured is accurate and consistent; crucial for patient safety and care quality,
Organising data in a searchable format to allow better data access.
Ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA by securely managing sensitive patient data and providing audit trails.
Benefits of IDP in healthcare
The implementation of IDP in healthcare comes with several benefits:
Increased efficiency: By automating routine tasks, healthcare providers can focus more on patient care rather than paperwork,
Cost reduction: IDP reduces the need for manual data entry and paper-based processes, leading to significant cost savings,
Better patient experience: Quick access to patient history and records leads to more informed decision-making and personalised care,
Scalability: As healthcare facilities grow, IDP systems can easily scale to manage increased data volumes without compromising performance.
Challenges in implementing IDP
While IDP offers many advantages, there are challenges to its adoption:
Integration with existing systems: Integrating IDP with current healthcare IT ecosystems can be complex and requires careful planning,
Data privacy concerns: Protecting patient data is paramount, and IDP must adhere to stringent security standards,
Change management: Staff may resist shifting from manual to automated processes, necessitating adequate training and change management strategies.
Future of IDP in healthcare
In the future, IDP is likely to increase its impact in the healthcare field. Given the rise of AI and machine learning, the corresponding systems will become increasingly sophisticated, likely providing predictive analytics and decision support services. This could help improve diagnostic precision and create a more personalised patient treatment plan, eventually leading to better outcomes. In addition, IDP may facilitate data exchange between different healthcare systems.
Conclusion
Intelligent document processing is a typical solution that is bound to become increasingly impactful in healthcare. It may help healthcare professionals deal more effectively with the contemporary challenges of patient data. Although challenges exist, the potential results of improved client care, decreased expenses, and more precise data make IDP an invaluable asset. Thus, it can be concluded that Intelligent Document Processing should be considered one of the healthcare industry’s future solutions in its quest toward digitalisation.

Meta offers a glimpse through its supposed iPhone killer: Orion

For years, Silicon Valley and Wall Street have questioned Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to invest tens of billions of dollars into Reality Labs. This week, Meta’s wearables division unveiled a prototype of its Orion smart glasses, a form factor the company believes one day could replace the iPhone. That idea sounds crazy… but maybe a little less crazy than it did a week ago.
Orion is a prototype headset that combines augmented reality, eye and hand tracking, generative AI, and a gesture-detecting wristband. Through micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses (which are quite expensive), Meta seems to have cracked a longstanding AR display challenge. The idea is that you can look through Orion — you know, like a pair of glasses — but also see application windows projected on the lenses that appear as if they’re embedded in the world around you. Ideally, you can use your hands, eyes, and voice to navigate the environment.

Though to be clear, Meta’s Orion smart glasses are chunkier than your average readers, reportedly cost $10,000 a pop, and won’t be available for sale anytime soon. We’re talking years from now. All the technology in Orion is relatively young, and all of it needs to get cheaper, better, and smaller to work its way into a pair of smart glasses you can buy at the mall. Zuckerberg says the company has already been working on Orion for 10 years, but there’s still no path to a sellable product.
However, Meta is hardly the only company trying to put a smartphone replacement on your face.
This month, Snap unveiled its latest generation of Spectacles smart glasses, which are larger than Orion and have a more limited field of view. One former Snap engineer called the latest Spectacles “obviously bad” — though you can actually order them. Google hinted during its I/O conference in May that it, too, is working on a pair of smart glasses, perhaps a revamp of its failed Google Glass experiment from last decade. Apple is reportedly working on AR glasses that sound a lot like Orion. And we can’t rule out Jony Ive’s new startup, LoveFrom, which he recently confirmed is working on an AI wearable with OpenAI (though we don’t know if they’re glasses, a pin, or something else entirely).
What’s brewing is a race among Big Tech’s richest companies to create a sleek pair of smart glasses that can do everything your smartphone can — and hopefully something more. Meta’s prototype made two things clear: there is something there, but we’re not “there” yet.
These devices are a notable departure from the Quest virtual reality headsets Meta has been pushing for years now, and Apple’s Vision Pro. There’s a lot of similar technology involved, like eye-tracking and hand tracking, but they feel completely different to use. VR headsets are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make people nauseous from staring at the displays. Sunglasses and eyeglasses, on the other hand, are relatively pleasant to wear and millions of Americans use them everyday.
To Zuckerberg’s credit, he’s been pushing the eyewear form factor for quite a long time, when it certainly was not popular to do so. It’s long been reported that Meta’s CEO hates that his popular social media apps have to be accessed through Apple’s phones (perhaps leading to the ill-fated Facebook Phone). Now, Meta’s competitors are also dipping their toes into eyewear computing.

Meta’s early investment here seems to be paying off. Zuckerberg gave a keynote presentation of Orion on Wednesday that we won’t be forgetting anytime soon, filling a room full of skeptical journalists with electricity and excitement. TechCrunch has not demoed Orion yet, but initial reviews have been very positive. 
What Meta offers today is the Ray-Ban Meta: a pair of glasses with cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, an on-device LLM, and the ability to connect to your phone and the cloud. The Ray-Ban Meta is far simpler than Orion, but relatively affordable at $299 — actually not much more than a regular pair of Ray-Bans. They’re kind of like the Spectacles 3 that Snap released a few years ago, though the Ray-Ban Meta glasses appear more popular. 
Despite the vast differences in price and capabilities, Orion and Ray-Ban Meta are more related than you might think.
“Orion is really the future, and we ultimately want to go for the full holographic experience. You can think about Ray-Ban Meta as our first step there,” said Li-Chen Miller, a VP of product at Meta who leads its wearables team, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We really need to nail the basic things, like making sure it’s comfortable, people want to wear it, and that people find value in it every day.”
One of the things Meta is trying to nail with Ray-Ban Meta is AI. Currently, the smart glasses use Meta’s Llama models to answer questions about what you see in front of you, by taking pictures and running them through the AI system alongside a user’s verbal requests. The Ray-Ban Meta’s AI features today are far from perfect: The latency is worse than OpenAI’s natural-feeling Advanced Voice Mode; Meta AI requires very specific prompts to work right; it hallucinates; and it doesn’t have a tight integration with many apps, making it less useful than just picking up my iPhone (perhaps by Apple’s design). But Meta’s updates coming later this year try to address these issues.

Meta announced it will soon release live AI video processing for their Ray-Bans, meaning the smart glasses will stream live video and verbal requests into one of Llama’s multimodal AI models and will produce real-time, verbal answers based on that input. It’s also getting basic features, like reminders, as well as more app integrations. That should make the whole experience a lot smoother, if it works. Miller says these improvements will filter up to Orion, which runs on the same generative AI systems.
“Some things make more sense for one form factor than the other, but we’re certainly cross-pollinating,” said Miller.
Likewise, she says some of Orion’s features may filter down as her team focuses on making the AR glasses more affordable. Orion’s various sensors and eye trackers are not cheap technologies. The problem is that Orion has to get both better and more economical.
Another challenge is typing. Your smartphone has a keyboard, but your smart glasses won’t. Miller worked on keyboards at Microsoft for nearly 20 years before joining Meta, but she says Orion’s lack of keyboard is “freeing.” She argues that using smart glasses will be a more natural experience than using a phone. You can simply talk, gesture with your hands, and look at things to navigate Orion; all things that come naturally to most people.
Another device that was criticized for lacking a keyboard was, ironically, the iPhone. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer infamously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, saying it wouldn’t appeal to business customers because it didn’t have a physical keyboard. People adapted though, and his comments sound naive more than 15 years later.
I think making Orion feel natural is definitely more of a goal than a reality at this point. The Verge notes in its hands-on review that windows occasionally filled the entire glasses lens, completely obstructing the user’s view of the world around them. That’s far from natural. To get there, Meta will have to improve its AI, typing, AR, and a long list of other features.
“For Ray-Ban Meta, we kept it very scoped to a few things, and then it does them really well,” said Miller. “Whereas, when you want to build a new, futuristic computing platform [with Orion], we have to do a lot of things, and do them all very well.”"2024-09-29 17:16:03: status=completed

Orion's technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. The device uses generative AI, eye and hand tracking, and gesture detection to enable users to navigate and interact with virtual objects. The technology is still developing, and Meta has acknowledged that it needs to get cheaper, better, and smaller to work its way into a pair of smart glasses that can be sold at a reasonable price.

**The Competition**

Meta is not the only company working on smart glasses. Snap, Google, Apple, and Jony Ive's new startup, LoveFrom, are all working on similar projects. The competition is heating up, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.

**The Ray-Ban Meta**

Meta's Ray-Ban Meta is a more affordable option, priced at $299, which is relatively cheap compared to Orion. The Ray-Ban Meta has cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, an on-device LLM, and the ability to connect to a phone and the cloud. While it is not as advanced as Orion, it is a step in the right direction, and Meta's VP of product, Li-Chen Miller, has stated that the company is using the Ray-Ban Meta as a stepping stone to develop more advanced features for Orion.

**The Future of Computing**

Orion and the Ray-Ban Meta are just the beginning of a new era in computing. As the technology advances, we can expect to see more devices that enable users to interact with virtual objects in a more natural and intuitive way.

Augmented Intelligence claims its symbolic AI can make chatbots more useful
Kyle Wiggers
6:57 AM PDT • September 30, 2024
Comment

An alternative to the neural network architectures at the heart of AI models like OpenAI’s o1 is having a moment. Called symbolic AI, it uses rules pertaining to particular tasks, like rewriting lines of text, to solve larger problems.
Symbolic AI can deftly tackle some problems that neural networks struggle with. And recent  research has shown that it can be scalable. (Historically, symbolic architectures haven’t been compute-efficient.)
The scalability breakthroughs have fueled a wellspring of startups applying symbolic AI to various domains, like Orby and TekTonic (which are building enterprise automation tools), Symbolica, and Unlikely AI (founded by Alexa co-creator William Tunstall-Pedoe). One of the newest ventures to emerge from stealth is Augmented Intelligence, backed by $44 million from investors including former IBM President Jim Whitehurst.
Augmented Intelligence builds conversational AI that it claims is both more predictable and “agentic” — the latest AI buzzword du jour — than your typical neural network-based system. For example, instead of simply answering a question about flights to Mexico with instructions on how to book, Augmented Intelligence’s AI can give a list of fares and book the flight for you, CEO Ohad Elhelo says.
But wait — can’t ChatGPT already do that? Yes, Elhelo admits. But he claims that it requires more setup and manual integration than Augmented Intelligence’s tech.
“There’s a big difference between chatbots like ChatGPT, whose primary goal is to chat with the user, and conversational agents that take actions or work on behalf of companies,” Elhelo told TechCrunch. “Once you connect the AI to tools — either to retrieve information or to act — the model is not relying anymore on its training data, and the quality of intelligence drops dramatically.”
Elhelo co-founded Augmented Intelligence with Ori Cohen in 2017. Back then, the company had a different name — Delegate (and before that, Stuff) — and had a different, more polarizing mission: providing an AI-powered app where customers could delegate tasks to low-paid gig workers. 
Elhelo gave the elevator pitch for Delegate in a 2019 interview: “If an hour of [a business exec’s] time is worth, let’s say $50, why spend it on the phone with customer service or reading online customer reviews when there’s someone else in India, East Jerusalem, or the Philippines willing to do it for much less?”
Delegate’s scathing Glassdoor reviews suggest that it was difficult for gig workers to make much money at all. Workers complain of bugs and a “waitlising” system that made the platform difficult to use, little-to-no support or training, and an incentive structure that dangled the promise of higher pay but rarely awarded it.
So — under pressure to pivot — Elhelo and Cohen embraced the AI route. 
Augmented Intelligence’s AI can power chatbots that answer questions about any number of topics (e.g. “Do you price match on this product?”), integrating with a company’s existing APIs and workflows. Elhelo claims the AI was trained on conversation data from tens of thousands of human customer service agents. 
I asked Elhelo if the conversations came from Delegate. He wouldn’t say — nor would he say whether any agents were paid for their contributions, or whether agents were informed that their data would be used in this way.
Setting aside for a moment peoples’ feelings on brand chatbots, why would a company choose Augmented Intelligence over another AI vendor? Well, for one, Elhelo says that its AI is trained to use tools to bring in info from outside sources to complete tasks. AI from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others can similarly make use of tools, but Elhelo claims that Augmented Intelligence’s AI performs better than neural network-driven solutions.
The AI is also more explainable because it provides a log of how it responded to queries and why, Elhelo asserts — giving companies a way to fine-tune and improve its performance. And it doesn’t train on a company’s data, using only the resources it’s been given permission to access for specific contexts, Elhelo says.
“Augmented Intelligence does not require training on company information,” Elhelo said, “and takes into consideration the deploying company’s rule-based instructions.”
That bit about not training on customer data will surely appeal to businesses wary of exposing secrets to a third-party AI. Apple, among others, reportedly banned staff from using OpenAI tools last year, citing concerns about confidential data leakage.
Now, Elhelo makes some dubious claims, like that Augmented Intelligence’s AI can “eliminate hallucinations” (it most certainly cannot). But the 40-employee company appears to be winning business nonetheless, most recently securing a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to bring its models to the platform.
Elhelo wouldn’t share info on revenue. But he did tell TechCrunch that Augmented Intelligence’s last $10 million fundraising round, led by New Era Capital Partners, valued it at $350 million — a relatively high figure for an AI vendor that only recently brought its product to market (and wasn’t founded by a titan of the AI industry).
“Traditional models excel at pattern recognition and language generation,” Elhelo said. “However, these architectures fall short in situations where the model needs to perform actions, make decisions, or interact with tools. Apollo’s neuro-symbolic architecture and possibilities it unlocks for companies solves those problems.”

It’s sometimes difficult to distinguish the reality of technology from the hype and marketing messages that bombard our inboxes daily. In just the last five years, we’ve probably heard too much about the metaverse, blockchain and virtual reality, for example. At present, we’re in the midst of a furore about the much-abused term ‘AI’, and time will tell whether this particular storm will be seen as a teacup resident.
Artificial Intelligence News spoke exclusively to Jon McLoone, the Director of Technical Communication and Strategy at of one the most mature organisations in the computational intelligence and scientific innovation space, Wolfram Research, to help us put our present concepts of AI and their practical uses into a deeper context.
Jon has worked at Wolfram Research for 32 years in various roles, currently leading the European Technical Services team. A mathematician by training and a skilled practitioner in many aspects of data analysis, we began our interview by having him describe Wolfram’s work in an elevator pitch format.
Jon McLoone
“Our value proposition is that we know computation and Wolfram technology. We tailor our technology to the problem that an organisation has. That’s across a broad range of things. So, we don’t have a typical customer. What they have in common is they’re doing something innovative.”
“We’re doing problem-solving, the type of things that use computation and data science. We’re building out a unified platform for computation, and when we talk about computation, we mean the kinds of technical computing, like engineering calculations, data science and machine learning. It’s things like social network analysis, biosciences, actuarial science, and financial computations. Abstractly, these are all fundamentally mathematical things.”
“Our world is all those structured areas where we’ve spent 30 years building out different ontologies. We have a symbolic representation of the maths, but also things like graphs and networks, documents, videos, images, audio, time series, entities in the real world, like cities, rivers, and mountains. My team is doing the fun stuff of actually making it do something useful!”
“AI we just see as another kind of computation. There were different algorithms that have been developed over years, some of them hundreds of years ago, some of them only tens of years ago. Gen AI just adds to this list.”
Claims made about AI in 2024 can sometimes be overoptimistic, so we need to be realistic about its capabilities and consider what it excels at and where it falls short.
“There’s still human intelligence, which still remains as the strategic element. You’re not going to say, in the next five years AI will run my company and make decisions. Generative AI is very fluent but is unreliable. Its job is to be plausible, not to be correct. And particularly when you get into the kinds of things Wolfram does, it’s terrible because it will tell you the kinds of things that your mathematical answer would look like.” (Artificial Intelligence News‘ italics.)
The work of Wolfram Research in this context focuses on what Jon terms ‘symbolic AI’. To differentiate generative and symbolic AI, he gave us the analogy of modelling the trajectory of a thrown ball. A generative AI would learn how the ball travels by examining many thousands of such throws and then be able to produce a description of the trajectory. “That description would be plausible. That kind of model is data-rich, understanding poor.”
A symbolic representation of the thrown ball, on the other hand, would involve differential equations for projectile motion and representations of elements: mass, viscosity of the atmosphere, friction, and many other factors. “It could then be asked, ‘What happens if I throw the ball on Mars?’ It’ll say something accurate. It’s not going to fail.”
The ideal way to solve business (or scientific, medical, or engineering) problems is a combination of human intelligence, symbolic reasoning, as epitomised in Wolfram Language, and what we now term AI acting as the glue between them. AI is a great technology for interpreting meaning and acting as an interface between the component parts.
“Some of the interesting crossovers are where we take natural language and turn that into some structured information that you can then compute with. Human language is very messy and ambiguous, and generative AI is very good at mapping that to some structure. Once you’re in a structured world of something that is syntactically formal, then you can do things on it.”
A recent example of combining ‘traditional’ AI with the work of Wolfram involved medical records:
“We did a project recently taking medical reports, which were handwritten, typed and digital. But they contain words, and trying to do statistics on those isn’t possible. And so, you’ve got to use the generative AI part for mapping all of these words to things like classes: was this an avoidable death? Yes. No. That’s a nice, structured key value pair. And then once we’ve got that information in structured form (for example a piece of JSON or XML, or whatever your chosen structure), we can then do classical statistics to start saying, ‘Is there a trend? Can we project? Was there an impact from COVID on hospital harms?’ Clear-cut questions that you can approach symbolically with things like means and medians and models.”
During our interview, Jon also gave a précis of a presentation, which took as its example of his organisation’s work, an imaginary peanut butter cup manufacturing plant. What might be the effects of changing out a particular ingredient or altering some detail of the recipe and the effects of that change on the product’s shelf life?
“LLMs (large language models) will say, ‘Oh, they’ll probably last a few weeks because peanut butter cups usually sit on the shelf a few weeks. But going to a computational model that can plug into the ingredients, and compute, and you’ll know this thing should last for eight weeks before it goes off. Or what that change might do to the manufacturing process? A computational model can connect to the digital twin of your manufacturing plant and learn, ‘That will slow things down by 3%, so your productivity will fall by 20% because it creates a bottleneck here.’ LLMs are great at connecting you and your question to the model, maths, data science or the database. And that’s really an interesting three-way meeting of minds.”
You can catch Wolfram Research at the upcoming TechEx event in Amsterdam, October 1-2, at stand 166 of the AI & Big Data strand. We can’t guarantee any peanut butter-related discussion at the event, but to discover how powerful modelling and generative AI can be harnessed to solve your specific problems and quandaries, contact the company via its website.

Regulations to help or hinder: Cloudflare’s take
About the Author
By Dashveenjit Kaur |
 October 1, 2024
 Categories:
 Artificial Intelligence,
 Companies,
 Enterprise,
 Privacy,
 Security,
Dashveenjit is an experienced tech and business journalist with a determination to find and produce stories for online and print daily. She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.
As AI reshapes the digital landscape, tech companies find themselves in a high-stakes game of regulatory chess, with each move potentially changing the possibilities stemming from innovation. The game board is especially intricate for global infrastructure providers like Cloudflare, involving as it does cybersecurity, data privacy, and content moderation in a complex policy framework.
“No one wants to miss the boat,” says Alissa Starzak, the company’s deputy chief legal officer and global head of public policy, referring to the rush to regulate AI. Yet, she cautions the tension between urgent action and measured response that encapsulates the complex balancing act Cloudflare navigates daily.
In a recent interview with Artificial Intelligence News, Starzak revealed how the internet infrastructure giant is working to shape a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while safeguarding against emerging cyber threats.
The AI regulatory conundrum: Speed vs. caution
Regulators worldwide face the question of how to mandate as AI technology advances. Urgency is muted by a significant fact: the main dimensions of potential AI are not fully understood yet. “No one really knows yet,” Starzak said, highlighting the challenge of crafting regulations for a technology with unknown scope.
A lack of knowledge has led to producing responsible AI development and deployment frameworks that are speculative. An example would be the AI risk framework set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which Starzak said were meaningful steps towards the goal. Voluntary guidelines provide companies with a roadmap for creating AI risk assessment measures and encourage them to do so without stifling innovation.
The tightrope of global regulatory harmonisation
Cloudflare is congnisant of the complexities of achieving regulatory harmony across different jurisdictions, particularly in data protection and privacy. Starzak used the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to illustrate the benefits and challenges of sweeping regulatory frameworks.
It is noteworthy that GDPR has a significant role in consolidating privacy norms internationally. Starzak said that its real-life application does not always harmonise with the functioning of the internet. “It doesn’t actually feel like the way the internet necessarily works in practice,” she said, referring to restrictions on data transfers between jurisdictions.
This disconnect highlights a broader challenge: crafting regulations that protect consumers and national interests without impeding the global nature of the internet and digital commerce. Starzak emphasised the need for regulatory mechanisms that are “consistent across jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but enable information to travel.”
The imperative of targeted, narrow actions
Starzak advocates for a more nuanced, targeted approach to cybersecurity measures and content moderation. Her philosophy is rooted in recognising that broad, sweeping actions often have unintended consequences that can harm the ecosystem they aim to protect.
In terms of cybersecurity, Starzak stressed the importance of proportionality. She drew a stark contrast between targeted actions, like removing a specific piece of content, and drastic measures, like complete internet shutdowns. “The narrower that you can go, the better off you’re going to be from an open internet standpoint,” she said.
The principle extends to content moderation as well. As Starzak describes, the approach by Cloudflare involves carefully distinguishing between different types of services and their impacts. By doing so, the company aims to make more precise, effective decisions that address specific issues without unnecessarily compromising the broader internet ecosystem.
Balancing innovation and regulation in AI
The rapid advancement of AI technology presents a unique regulatory challenge. Starzak highlighted the risk of over-regulation stifling innovation and concentrating power in the hands of a few large players. “If you regulate it too much, you restrict the industry in a very significant way and make it really only available to a very small number of players,” she said.
Starzak advocates a regulatory approach that encourages responsible innovation while addressing potential harms. This includes promoting the development and adoption of AI risk assessment frameworks and encouraging industry self-regulation through model testing and ‘red teaming.’
The path forward: collaboration and flexibility
Starzak emphasises the need for ongoing dialogue and flexibility in regulatory approaches to AI and cybersecurity. She highlighted the importance of industry, government, and civil society collaboration to develop effective, balanced regulations.
According to Starzak, the key is to focus on specific harms and consumer protection rather than broad, sweeping regulations. “You have to go in with a purpose,” she stated, urging regulators to understand and articulate the problems they’re trying to solve.
A targeted approach, combined with willingness to adapt as technologies evolve offers a path forward through the complex internet and AI regulation world. As Cloudflare continues to navigate this landscape, Starzak’s insights provide a roadmap for balancing innovation, security, and responsible governance.
As the tech industry and regulators grapple with the challenge of creating effective governance frameworks, Cloudflare’s approach emphasises targeted actions, global harmonisation efforts, and regulatory flexibility. It represents a thoughtful perspective in the dialogue between tech companies and policymakers.
The way forward likely involves collaborative efforts from various stakeholders, including industry leaders, government bodies, and civil society organisations. The focus remains on striking a balance between protecting users and fostering innovation. This goal requires ongoing adaptation and cooperation across the tech ecosystem.

Cloudflare is cognizant of the complexities of achieving regulatory harmony across different jurisdictions, particularly in data protection and privacy. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a significant role in consolidating privacy norms internationally. However, its real-life application does not always harmonize with the functioning of the internet. Crafting regulations that protect consumers and national interests without impeding the global nature of the internet and digital commerce is a significant challenge.

**The Imperative of Targeted, Narrow Actions**

Cloudflare advocates for a more nuanced, targeted approach to cybersecurity measures and content moderation. The philosophy is rooted in recognizing that broad, sweeping actions often have unintended consequences that can harm the ecosystem they aim to protect. In terms of cybersecurity, the importance of proportionality is stressed. Targeted actions, like removing a specific piece of content, are preferred over drastic measures, like complete internet shutdowns.

**Balancing Innovation and Regulation in AI**

The rapid advancement of AI technology presents a unique regulatory challenge. The risk of over-regulation stifling innovation and concentrating power in the hands of a few large players is significant. Cloudflare advocates a regulatory approach that encourages responsible innovation while addressing potential harms. This includes promoting the development and adoption of AI risk assessment frameworks and encouraging industry self-regulation through model testing and 'red teaming.'

**The Path Forward: Collaboration and Flexibility**

Cloudflare emphasizes the need for ongoing dialogue and flexibility in regulatory approaches to AI and cybersecurity. Industry, government, and civil society collaboration are essential to develop effective, balanced regulations. A targeted approach, combined with a willingness to adapt as technologies evolve, offers a path forward through the complex internet and AI regulation world.

**Conclusion**

As the tech industry and regulators grapple with the challenge of creating effective governance frameworks, Cloudflare's approach emphasizes targeted actions, global harmonization efforts, and regulatory flexibility. It represents a thoughtful perspective in the dialogue between tech companies and policymakers. The way forward likely involves collaborative efforts from various stakeholders, including industry leaders, government bodies, and civil society organizations. The focus remains on striking a balance between protecting users and fostering innovation.2024-10-02 22:22:51: status=completed

Ahead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, AI News caught up with Ivo Everts, Senior Solutions Architect at Databricks, to discuss several key developments set to shape the future of open-source AI and data governance. 
One of Databricks’ notable achievements is the DBRX model, which set a new standard for open large language models (LLMs). 
“Upon release, DBRX outperformed all other leading open models on standard benchmarks and has up to 2x faster inference than models like Llama2-70B,” Everts explains. “It was trained more efficiently due to a variety of technological advances. 
“From a quality standpoint, we believe that DBRX is one of the best open-source models out there and when we refer to ‘best’ this means a wide range of industry benchmarks, including language understanding (MMLU), Programming (HumanEval), and Math (GSM8K).” 
The open-source AI model aims to “democratise the training of custom LLMs beyond a small handful of model providers and show organisations that they can train world-class LLMs on their data in a cost-effective way.” 
In line with their commitment to open ecosystems, Databricks has also open-sourced Unity Catalog. 
“Open-sourcing Unity Catalog enhances its adoption across cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) and on-premise infrastructures,” Everts notes. “This flexibility allows organisations to uniformly apply data governance policies regardless of where the data is stored or processed.” 
Unity Catalog addresses the challenges of data sprawl and inconsistent access controls through various features: 
Centralised data access management: “Unity Catalog centralises the governance of data assets, allowing organisations to manage access controls in a unified manner,” Everts states. 
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): According to Everts, Unity Catalog “implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing organisations to assign roles and permissions based on user profiles.” 
Data lineage and auditing: This feature “helps organisations monitor data usage and dependencies, making it easier to identify and eliminate redundant or outdated data,” Everts explains. He adds that it also “logs all data access and changes, providing a detailed audit trail to ensure compliance with data security policies.” 
Cross-cloud and hybrid support: Everts points out that Unity Catalog “is designed to manage data governance in multi-cloud and hybrid environments” and “ensures that data is governed uniformly, regardless of where it resides.” 
The company has introduced Databricks AI/BI, a new business intelligence product that leverages generative AI to enhance data exploration and visualisation. Everts believes that “a truly intelligent BI solution needs to understand the unique semantics and nuances of a business to effectively answer questions for business users.” 
The AI/BI system includes two key components: 
Dashboards: Everts describes this as “an AI-powered, low-code interface for creating and distributing fast, interactive dashboards.” These include “standard BI features like visualisations, cross-filtering, and periodic reports without needing additional management services.” 
Genie: Everts explains this as “a conversational interface for addressing ad-hoc and follow-up questions through natural language.” He adds that it “learns from underlying data to generate adaptive visualisations and suggestions in response to user queries, improving over time through feedback and offering tools for analysts to refine its outputs.” 
Everts states that Databricks AI/BI is designed to provide “a deep understanding of your data’s semantics, enabling self-service data analysis for everyone in an organisation.” He notes it’s powered by “a compound AI system that continuously learns from usage across an organisation’s entire data stack, including ETL pipelines, lineage, and other queries.” 
Databricks also unveiled Mosaic AI, which Everts describes as “a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning and generative AI applications, integrating enterprise data for enhanced performance and governance.” 
Mosaic AI offers several key components, which Everts outlines: 
Unified tooling: Provides “tools for building, deploying, evaluating, and governing AI and ML solutions, supporting predictive models and generative AI applications.” 
Generative AI patterns: “Supports prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and pre-training, offering flexibility as business needs evolve.” 
Centralised model management: “Model Serving allows for centralised deployment, governance, and querying of AI models, including custom ML models and foundation models.” 
Monitoring and governance: “Lakehouse Monitoring and Unity Catalog ensure comprehensive monitoring, governance, and lineage tracking across the AI lifecycle.” 
Cost-effective custom LLMs: “Enables training and serving custom large language models at significantly lower costs, tailored to specific organisational domains.” 
Everts highlights that Mosaic AI’s approach to fine-tuning and customising foundation models includes unique features like “fast startup times” by “utilising in-cluster base model caching,” “live prompt evaluation” where users can “track how the model’s responses change throughout the training process,” and support for “custom pre-trained checkpoints.” 
At the heart of these innovations lies the Data Intelligence Platform, which Everts says “transforms data management by using AI models to gain deep insights into the semantics of enterprise data.” The platform combines features of data lakes and data warehouses, utilises Delta Lake technology for real-time data processing, and incorporates Delta Sharing for secure data exchange across organisational boundaries. 
Everts explains that the Data Intelligence Platform plays a crucial role in supporting new AI and data-sharing initiatives by providing: 
A unified data and AI platform that “combines the features of data lakes and data warehouses into a single architecture.” 
Delta Lake for real-time data processing, ensuring “reliable data governance, ACID transactions, and real-time data processing.” 
Collaboration and data sharing via Delta Sharing, enabling “secure and open data sharing across organisational boundaries.” 
Integrated support for machine learning and AI model development with popular libraries like MLflow, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. 
Scalability and performance through its cloud-native architecture and the Photon engine, “an optimised query execution engine.” 
As a key sponsor of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Databricks plans to showcase their open-source AI and data governance solutions during the event. 
“At our stand, we will also showcase how to create and deploy – with Lakehouse apps – a custom GenAI app from scratch using open-source models from Hugging Face and data from Unity Catalog,” says Everts. 
“With our GenAI app you can generate your own cartoon picture, all running on the Data Intelligence Platform.” 
Databricks will be sharing more of their expertise at this year’s AI & Big Data Expo Europe. Swing by Databricks’ booth at stand #280 to hear more about open AI and improving data governance.

Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers today, and Enterprise and Edu customers will likely get the feature next week. The feature is fully functional on desktops—mobile users can only view the canvas projects for now.During a prelaunch demo to WIRED, Levine focused on a hope for more “natural” feeling human-AI collaboration with this new option. His team used synthetic data generated by OpenAI’s latest model, o1-preview, to give GPT-4o’s model useful canvas features, like knowing when to activate and how much to adjust the document.With canvas, ChatGPT can generate a starting draft of a project for you and the AI to edit together, or you can paste an existing draft of what you’re working on for feedback. Levine started off by asking ChatGPT to use canvas to help draft a crucial email. He followed up by highlighting a couple of paragraphs and requesting specific changes. The generative AI tool is able to add comments in the canvas to note potential improvements or can even directly change what’s in the document.Courtesy of OpenAI.Opening a canvas is simple: Just add a phrase like “use canvas …” or “start a canvas …” to your prompt and the new window will appear. For some writing prompts, like requests to generate a draft blog post, the GPT-4o model is trained to launch a canvas without you even invoking the tool, if it's deemed helpful. For coding projects, the model only starts a canvas when directly requested.Most PopularGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasBy Scott GilbertsonGearHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Polestar?By Carlton ReidGearEverything Apple Announced TodayBy Boone AshworthGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuAlthough both writing and coding modes give the choice of requesting in-line edits, the bifurcated user interface for canvas is designed with one additional set of shortcuts for those focused on AI-assisted writing and another for coders. In the demo, Levine showed off how the writer’s shortcut could be used to condense the number of words in a canvas or attempt to perform a “final polish” on the draft. He also used one of the more lighthearted shortcuts to add a bunch of random emoji. On the coder’s side, ChatGPT can add logs, comments, and attempt to troubleshoot problems in a canvas.ChatGPT saves different versions of the canvas as you’re iterating, so you can return to old versions if you end up preferring that output. Writers who may be worried about what they upload being used by OpenAI to train its model should go into their user settings and make sure that “model training” is toggled off.By allowing ChatGPT to make edits as well as suggestions, OpenAI is blurring the line between authorship and word curation. As someone who works with professional editors daily, I’m skeptical the canvas beta will match their incisive notes and careful guidance. But for people who don’t have easy access to human writing partners, I can see how getting synthetic notes on a composition about structure and content would be beneficial.It’s worth noting that three people listed as “supporting leadership” on the canvas project are no longer with the company. Former post-training colead and cofounder John Schulman left in August and now works at Anthropic, a rival AI company. Additionally, former chief technology officer Mira Murati and research vice president Barret Zoph both stepped down from their positions a week before this launch. At a press event in the OpenAI office after the departures, current chief product officer Kevin Weil reaffirmed the company’s commitment to continue releasing software.“I think 2025 is gonna be the year that agentic systems finally hit the mainstream,” he says. The idea of an AI “agent” that can not only work through software tasks alongside you, but is also nimble enough to be sent off into the digital wilderness to do things on your behalf, is simultaneously generative AI’s recent past and projected future.Last year, WIRED covered ChatGPT’s plug-ins people could use for tasks, like booking flights with Expedia or making a reservation with OpenTable—arguably a step toward more “agentic” AI tools. However, plug-ins were later wound down, with more limited custom GPT chatbots launched in their place.Keeping that in mind, the beta release of canvas does appear to be another attempt at augmenting AI models with more decisionmaking abilities, which can lead to surprises. During one of WIRED’s demos, Levine highlighted a portion of the canvas and requested an edit, and ChatGPT subsequently made an in-line change near the bottom, outside his highlight. “The really interesting thing is oftentimes, if you highlight a section, it will make an edit in that part,” he says. “But ChatGPT has the option to decide where to edit.”The closest alternative to OpenAI’s canvas tool available right now is probably Google’s Gemini integration that lets you use generative AI inside of Docs or Anthropic's Artifacts tool. Chatbots definitely aren’t dead, but AI companies are now acknowledging the format’s constraints and looking for ways to diversify their software to uncover novel, sticky user interfaces. Google recently received praise in tech circles for its entertaining AI podcasts—even CEO Sam Altman lauded the tool.With billions of investment dollars still flowing through Silicon Valley to AI companies, consumers can expect to see more of these structural experiments that build on existing tools, like AI podcast hosts and AI document editors, to be released with a regular cadence over the next year. The chatbot race is far from over, and future iterations on the technology are likely to stray far away from that drab chatbox, and toward a more multifaceted approach.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED’s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoReece Rogers is WIRED's service writer, focused on explaining crucial topics and helping readers get the most out of their technology.

Now it will work with video and voice, too.Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoSave this storySaveSave this storySaveWhen Google Lens was introduced in 2017, the search feature accomplished a feat that not too long ago would have seemed like the stuff of science fiction: Point your phone’s camera at an object and Google Lens can identify it, show some context, maybe even let you buy it. It was a new way of searching, one that didn’t involve awkwardly typing out descriptions of things you were seeing in front of you.Lens also demonstrated how Google planned to use its machine learning and AI tools to ensure its search engine shows up on every possible surface. As Google increasingly uses its foundational generative AI models to generate summaries of information in response to text searches, Google Lens’ visual search has been evolving, too. And now the company says Lens, which powers around 20 billion searches per month, is going to support even more ways to search, including video and multimodal searches.Another tweak to Lens means even more context for shopping will show up in results. Shopping is, unsurprisingly, one of the key use cases for Lens; Amazon and Pinterest also have visual search tools designed to fuel more buying. Search for your friend’s sneakers in the old Google Lens, and you might have been shown a carousel of similar items. In the updated version of Lens, Google says it will show more direct links for purchasing, customer reviews, publisher reviews, and comparative shopping tools.Courtesy of GoogleLens search is now multimodal, a hot word in AI these days, which means people can now search with a combination of video, images, and voice inputs. Instead of pointing their smartphone camera at an object, tapping the focus point on the screen, and waiting for the Lens app to drum up results, users can point the lens and use voice commands at the same time, for example, “What kind of clouds are those?” or “What brand of sneakers are those and where can I buy them?”Lens will also start working over real-time video capture, taking the tool a step beyond identifying objects in still images. If you have a broken record player or see a flashing light on a malfunctioning appliance at home, you could snap a quick video through Lens and, through a generative AI overview, see tips on how to repair the item.First announced at I/O, this feature is considered experimental and is available only to people who have opted into Google’s search labs, says Rajan Patel, an 18-year Googler and a cofounder of Lens. The other Google Lens features, voice mode and expanded shopping, are rolling out more broadly.The “video understanding” feature, as Google calls it, is intriguing for a few reasons. While it currently works with video captured in real time, if or when Google expands it to captured videos, entire repositories of videos—whether in a person’s own camera roll or in a gargantuan database like Google—could potentially become taggable and overwhelmingly shoppable.Courtesy of GoogleThe second consideration is that this Lens feature shares some characteristics with Google’s Project Astra, which is expected to be available later this year. Astra, like Lens, uses multimodal inputs to interpret the world around you through your phone. As part of an Astra demo this spring, the company showed off a pair of prototype smart glasses.Separately, Meta just made a splash with its long-term vision for our augmented reality future, which involves mere mortals wearing dorky glasses that can smartly interpret the world around them and show them holographic interfaces. Google, of course, already tried to realize this future with Google Glass (which uses fundamentally different technology than that of Meta’s latest pitch). Are Lens’ new features, coupled with Astra, a natural segue to a new kind of smart glasses?Most PopularScience23andMe Is Sinking Fast. Can the Company Survive?By Emily MullinGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuSecurityThe Pig Butchering Invasion Has BegunBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 26 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenPatel was very demure when asked this question, saying that Meta’s announcement was “compelling” and pointing out that Lens was actually borne out of Google’s now-defunct Daydream team—which was focused on headset computing (though mostly on VR development rather than AR).“You can imagine we’re asking, ‘How do we make it even easier for people to ask questions? How can we answer questions more seamlessly? And what are all the capabilities we need to build?’” Patel says. “All of these are building blocks.”Lastly, and critically, having the ability to shoot video of the scene around you and immediately tap into the world’s database of information has some obvious and concerning privacy implications. Already a group of students claim to have adapted Meta’s widely available smart glasses with facial recognition technology and used the glasses to identify strangers.If you use Google Lens on your smartphone to capture a real-time video of a group of people dancing in a park—or, say, protesting in the streets—how will Lens process that information? Will it be capable of identifying the people in the frame?Patel says Len’s default will be to process, frame-to-frame, the context of the scene, “doing our best to ignore people’s faces” and instead identifying the location of the scene, or the song that’s playing, or, in some cases, the clothing people are wearing. (Always be shopping.)Lens may be trained to “do its best to ignore faces,” but it’s still a visual search tool that works by capturing images and videos that could include humans. Lens’ search may get better at answering our questions, but it also asks a massive one of its users, which is whether we can trust it.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED’s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoLauren Goode is a senior writer at WIRED covering Big Tech, Silicon Valley’s most interesting people, emerging trends in the tech industry, and how the culture of Silicon Valley influences the products we use.

**Multimodal Search Capability:**
One of the most significant updates to Google Lens is its ability to support multimodal searches. This means users can now search using a combination of video, images, and voice inputs. For instance, users can point their camera at an object and use voice commands to ask questions like "What kind of clouds are those?" or "What brand of sneakers are those and where can I buy them?" This feature has the potential to make search more natural and intuitive.

**Video Understanding:**
Another exciting feature announced by Google is the ability of Google Lens to work with real-time video capture. This means users can capture a quick video of an object or scene and Google Lens will provide tips on how to repair or interact with it. For example, if a user has a broken record player, they can capture a video of it, and Google Lens will provide instructions on how to fix it. This feature has immense potential for various applications, including DIY repairs and maintenance.

**Shopping Experience:**
Google Lens has also been enhanced to provide a more comprehensive shopping experience. When searching for a product, Google Lens will now show more direct links for purchasing, customer reviews, publisher reviews, and comparative shopping tools. This update is expected to make it easier for users to find and buy products they are interested in.

**Implications and Concerns:**
While the updates to Google Lens are exciting, they also raise some concerns about privacy. With the ability to capture and process video, there is a risk of facial recognition and other privacy violations. Google has assured that it will process video frame-by-frame, ignoring people's faces and focusing on the context of the scene. However, it remains to be seen how effective these measures will be in protecting user privacy.

**Future Possibilities:**
The updates to Google Lens have sparked speculation about its potential applications in augmented reality (AR) and smart glasses. Google's Project Astra, which uses multimodal inputs to interpret the world around us, shares some characteristics with Google Lens. It is possible that Google Lens will be integrated into future AR devices, enabling users to access information and make purchases seamlessly.

**Conclusion:**
Google's Visual Search Can Now Answer Even More Complex Questions is a significant milestone in the evolution of search technology. With its multimodal search capability, video understanding feature, and enhanced shopping experience, Google Lens is poised to revolutionize the way we interact with information. As Google continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible, it is essential to consider the implications of these technologies on our privacy and daily lives.2024-10-05 19:40:20: status=completed

When Google Lens was introduced in 2017, the search feature accomplished a feat that not too long ago would have seemed like the stuff of science fiction: Point your phone’s camera at an object and Google Lens can identify it, show some context, maybe even let you buy it. It was a new way of searching, one that didn’t involve awkwardly typing out descriptions of things you were seeing in front of you.
Lens also demonstrated how Google planned to use its machine learning and AI tools to ensure its search engine shows up on every possible surface. As Google increasingly uses its foundational generative AI models to generate summaries of information in response to text searches, Google Lens’ visual search has been evolving, too. And now the company says Lens, which powers around 20 billion searches per month, is going to support even more ways to search, including video and multimodal searches.
Another tweak to Lens means even more context for shopping will show up in results. Shopping is, unsurprisingly, one of the key use cases for Lens; Amazon and Pinterest also have visual search tools designed to fuel more buying. Search for your friend’s sneakers in the old Google Lens, and you might have been shown a carousel of similar items. In the updated version of Lens, Google says it will show more direct links for purchasing, customer reviews, publisher reviews, and comparative shopping tools.

Lens search is now multimodal, a hot word in AI these days, which means people can now search with a combination of video, images, and voice inputs. Instead of pointing their smartphone camera at an object, tapping the focus point on the screen, and waiting for the Lens app to drum up results, users can point the lens and use voice commands at the same time, for example, “What kind of clouds are those?” or “What brand of sneakers are those and where can I buy them?”
Lens will also start working over real-time video capture, taking the tool a step beyond identifying objects in still images. If you have a broken record player or see a flashing light on a malfunctioning appliance at home, you could snap a quick video through Lens and, through a generative AI overview, see tips on how to repair the item.
First announced at I/O, this feature is considered experimental and is available only to people who have opted into Google’s search labs, says Rajan Patel, an 18-year Googler and a cofounder of Lens. The other Google Lens features, voice mode and expanded shopping, are rolling out more broadly.
The “video understanding” feature, as Google calls it, is intriguing for a few reasons. While it currently works with video captured in real time, if or when Google expands it to captured videos, entire repositories of videos—whether in a person’s own camera roll or in a gargantuan database like Google—could potentially become taggable and overwhelmingly shoppable.

The second consideration is that this Lens feature shares some characteristics with Google’s Project Astra, which is expected to be available later this year. Astra, like Lens, uses multimodal inputs to interpret the world around you through your phone. As part of an Astra demo this spring, the company showed off a pair of prototype smart glasses.
Separately, Meta just made a splash with its long-term vision for our augmented reality future, which involves mere mortals wearing dorky glasses that can smartly interpret the world around them and show them holographic interfaces. Google, of course, already tried to realize this future with Google Glass (which uses fundamentally different technology than that of Meta’s latest pitch). Are Lens’ new features, coupled with Astra, a natural segue to a new kind of smart glasses?

A new study by researchers at King’s Business School and Wazoku has revealed that AI is transforming global problem-solving.
The report found that nearly half (46%) of Wazoku’s 700,000-strong network of problem solvers had utilised generative AI (GenAI) to work on innovative ideas over the past year. This network – known as the Wazoku Crowd – comprises a diverse group of professionals including scientists, pharmacists, engineers, PhD students, CEOs, start-ups, and business leaders.
Perhaps more strikingly, almost a quarter (22%) of respondents reported using GenAI or LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Claude for at least half of their idea submissions, with 8% employing these technologies for every single submission. Of those using GenAI, 47% are leveraging it specifically for idea generation.
The Wazoku Crowd’s collective intelligence is harnessed to solve ‘challenges’ – requests for ideas submitted by enterprises – with an impressive success rate of over 80%.
Simon Hill, CEO of Wazoku, commented on the findings: “There’s an incredible amount of hype with GenAI, but alongside that there is enormous curiosity. Getting immersed in something and being curious is an innovator’s dream, so there is rich potential with GenAI.”
However, Hill also urged caution: “A note of caution, though – it is best used to generate interest, not solutions. Human ingenuity and creativity are still best, although using GenAI can undoubtedly make that process more effective.”
The study revealed that the most common application of GenAI was in research and learning, with 85% of respondents using it for this purpose. Additionally, around one-third of the Wazoku Crowd employed GenAI for report structuring, writing, and data analysis and insight.
The research was conducted in partnership with Oguz A. Acar, Professor of Marketing and Innovation at King’s Business School, King’s College London. Professor Acar viewed the study as a crucial first step towards understanding AI’s potential and limitations in tackling complex innovation challenges.
“Everyone’s trying to figure out what AI can and can’t do, and this survey is a step forward in understanding that,” Professor Acar stated. “It reveals that some crowd members view GenAI as a valuable ally, using it to research, create, and communicate more effectively.”
“While perhaps it’s no surprise that those open to innovation are curious about new tools, the survey also shows mixed opinions. Most people haven’t used GenAI tools yet, highlighting that we’re only beginning to uncover AI’s potential in innovative problem-solving.”
Wazoku collaborates with a range of customers, including Sanofi, A2A, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and numerous global enterprise businesses, government departments, and not-for-profits, to crowdsource ideas and innovation.
Recently, Wazoku launched its own conversational AI to aid innovation. Dubbed Jen AI, this digital innovation assistant has access to Wazoku’s connected innovation management suite—aimed at accelerating decision-making around innovation and enhancing productivity to deliver consistent, scalable results.
“The solutions to the world’s problems are complex, and the support of AI brings vast benefits in terms of efficiency, creativity, and insight generation,” explained Hill.
As the adoption of AI in innovation processes continues to grow, it’s clear that – while these tools offer significant potential – they are best used to augment rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving skills.

A new study by researchers at King’s Business School and Wazoku has revealed that AI is transforming global problem-solving.
The report found that nearly half (46%) of Wazoku’s 700,000-strong network of problem solvers had utilised generative AI (GenAI) to work on innovative ideas over the past year. This network – known as the Wazoku Crowd – comprises a diverse group of professionals including scientists, pharmacists, engineers, PhD students, CEOs, start-ups, and business leaders.
Perhaps more strikingly, almost a quarter (22%) of respondents reported using GenAI or LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Claude for at least half of their idea submissions, with 8% employing these technologies for every single submission. Of those using GenAI, 47% are leveraging it specifically for idea generation.
The Wazoku Crowd’s collective intelligence is harnessed to solve ‘challenges’ – requests for ideas submitted by enterprises – with an impressive success rate of over 80%.
Simon Hill, CEO of Wazoku, commented on the findings: “There’s an incredible amount of hype with GenAI, but alongside that there is enormous curiosity. Getting immersed in something and being curious is an innovator’s dream, so there is rich potential with GenAI.”
However, Hill also urged caution: “A note of caution, though – it is best used to generate interest, not solutions. Human ingenuity and creativity are still best, although using GenAI can undoubtedly make that process more effective.”
The study revealed that the most common application of GenAI was in research and learning, with 85% of respondents using it for this purpose. Additionally, around one-third of the Wazoku Crowd employed GenAI for report structuring, writing, and data analysis and insight.
The research was conducted in partnership with Oguz A. Acar, Professor of Marketing and Innovation at King’s Business School, King’s College London. Professor Acar viewed the study as a crucial first step towards understanding AI’s potential and limitations in tackling complex innovation challenges.
“Everyone’s trying to figure out what AI can and can’t do, and this survey is a step forward in understanding that,” Professor Acar stated. “It reveals that some crowd members view GenAI as a valuable ally, using it to research, create, and communicate more effectively.”
“While perhaps it’s no surprise that those open to innovation are curious about new tools, the survey also shows mixed opinions. Most people haven’t used GenAI tools yet, highlighting that we’re only beginning to uncover AI’s potential in innovative problem-solving.”
Wazoku collaborates with a range of customers, including Sanofi, A2A, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and numerous global enterprise businesses, government departments, and not-for-profits, to crowdsource ideas and innovation.
Recently, Wazoku launched its own conversational AI to aid innovation. Dubbed Jen AI, this digital innovation assistant has access to Wazoku’s connected innovation management suite—aimed at accelerating decision-making around innovation and enhancing productivity to deliver consistent, scalable results.
“The solutions to the world’s problems are complex, and the support of AI brings vast benefits in terms of efficiency, creativity, and insight generation,” explained Hill.
As the adoption of AI in innovation processes continues to grow, it’s clear that – while these tools offer significant potential – they are best used to augment rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving skills.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we approach problem-solving in various industries. A recent study by researchers at King’s Business School and Wazoku has revealed that AI is transforming global problem-solving. The report found that nearly half (46%) of Wazoku’s 700,000-strong network of problem solvers had utilized generative AI (GenAI) to work on innovative ideas over the past year.

The study highlighted that 22% of respondents reported using GenAI or LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Claude for at least half of their idea submissions, with 8% employing these technologies for every single submission. Of those using GenAI, 47% are leveraging it specifically for idea generation. The Wazoku Crowd’s collective intelligence is harnessed to solve ‘challenges’ – requests for ideas submitted by enterprises – with an impressive success rate of over 80%.

The research revealed that the most common application of GenAI was in research and learning, with 85% of respondents using it for this purpose. Additionally, around one-third of the Wazoku Crowd employed GenAI for report structuring, writing, and data analysis and insight.

The study was conducted in partnership with Oguz A. Acar, Professor of Marketing and Innovation at King’s Business School, King’s College London. Professor Acar viewed the study as a crucial first step towards understanding AI’s potential and limitations in tackling complex innovation challenges.

The collaboration between Wazoku and King’s Business School has led to the development of Jen AI, a conversational AI designed to aid innovation. This digital innovation assistant has access to Wazoku’s connected innovation management suite, aimed at accelerating decision-making around innovation and enhancing productivity to deliver consistent, scalable results.

As the adoption of AI in innovation processes continues to grow, it is clear that – while these tools offer significant potential – they are best used to augment rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving skills. The study’s findings suggest that AI is transforming problem-solving by enhancing efficiency, creativity, and insight generation, but human ingenuity and creativity are still essential in the innovation process.

This research report provides valuable insights into the current state of AI adoption in problem-solving and highlights the potential benefits and limitations of AI in driving innovation. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial for businesses and organizations to understand its capabilities and limitations in order to harness its full potential.2024-10-07 22:45:44: status=completed

Han Heloir, MongoDB: The role of scalable databases in AI-powered apps
About the Author
By Muhammad Zulhusni |

 Categories:
 Applications,
 Artificial Intelligence,
 cloud,
As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
As data management grows more complex and modern applications extend the capabilities of traditional approaches, AI is revolutionising application scaling.
Han Heloir, EMEA gen AI senior solutions architect, MongoDB.
In addition to freeing operators from outdated, inefficient methods that require careful supervision and extra resources, AI enables real-time, adaptive optimisation of application scaling. Ultimately, these benefits combine to enhance efficiency and reduce costs for targeted applications.
With its predictive capabilities, AI ensures that applications scale efficiently, improving performance and resource allocation—marking a major advance over conventional methods.
Ahead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Han Heloir, EMEA gen AI senior solutions architect at MongoDB, discusses the future of AI-powered applications and the role of scalable databases in supporting generative AI and enhancing business processes.
AI News: As AI-powered applications continue to grow in complexity and scale, what do you see as the most significant trends shaping the future of database technology?
Heloir: While enterprises are keen to leverage the transformational power of generative AI technologies, the reality is that building a robust, scalable technology foundation involves more than just choosing the right technologies. It’s about creating systems that can grow and adapt to the evolving demands of generative AI, demands that are changing quickly, some of which traditional IT infrastructure may not be able to support. That is the uncomfortable truth about the current situation.
Today’s IT architectures are being overwhelmed by unprecedented data volumes generated from increasingly interconnected data sets. Traditional systems, designed for less intensive data exchanges, are currently unable to handle the massive, continuous data streams required for real-time AI responsiveness. They are also unprepared to manage the variety of data being generated.
The generative AI ecosystem often comprises a complex set of technologies. Each layer of technology—from data sourcing to model deployment—increases functional depth and operational costs. Simplifying these technology stacks isn’t just about improving operational efficiency; it’s also a financial necessity.
AI News: What are some key considerations for businesses when selecting a scalable database for AI-powered applications, especially those involving generative AI?
Heloir: Businesses should prioritise flexibility, performance and future scalability. Here are a few key reasons:
The variety and volume of data will continue to grow, requiring the database to handle diverse data types—structured, unstructured, and semi-structured—at scale. Selecting a database that can manage such variety without complex ETL processes is important.
AI models often need access to real-time data for training and inference, so the database must offer low latency to enable real-time decision-making and responsiveness.
As AI models grow and data volumes expand, databases must scale horizontally, to allow organisations to add capacity without significant downtime or performance degradation.
Seamless integration with data science and machine learning tools is crucial, and native support for AI workflows—such as managing model data, training sets and inference data—can enhance operational efficiency.
AI News: What are the common challenges organisations face when integrating AI into their operations, and how can scalable databases help address these issues?
Heloir: There are a variety of challenges that organisations can run into when adopting AI. These include the massive amounts of data from a wide variety of sources that are required to build AI applications. Scaling these initiatives can also put strain on the existing IT infrastructure and once the models are built, they require continuous iteration and improvement.
To make this easier, a database that scales can help simplify the management, storage and retrieval of diverse datasets. It offers elasticity, allowing businesses to handle fluctuating demands while sustaining performance and efficiency. Additionally, they accelerate time-to-market for AI-driven innovations by enabling rapid data ingestion and retrieval, facilitating faster experimentation.
AI News: Could you provide examples of how collaborations between database providers and AI-focused companies have driven innovation in AI solutions?
Heloir: Many businesses struggle to build generative AI applications because the technology evolves so quickly. Limited expertise and the increased complexity of integrating diverse components further complicate the process, slowing innovation and hindering the development of AI-driven solutions.
One way we address these challenges is through our MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP), which provides customers with resources to assist them in putting AI applications into production. This includes reference architectures and an end-to-end technology stack that integrates with leading technology providers, professional services and a unified support system.
MAAP categorises customers into four groups, ranging from those seeking advice and prototyping to those developing mission-critical AI applications and overcoming technical challenges. MongoDB’s MAAP enables faster, seamless development of generative AI applications, fostering creativity and reducing complexity.
AI News: How does MongoDB approach the challenges of supporting AI-powered applications, particularly in industries that are rapidly adopting AI?
Heloir: Ensuring you have the underlying infrastructure to build what you need is always one of the biggest challenges organisations face.
To build AI-powered applications, the underlying database must be capable of running queries against rich, flexible data structures. With AI, data structures can become very complex. This is one of the biggest challenges organisations face when building AI-powered applications, and it’s precisely what MongoDB is designed to handle. We unify source data, metadata, operational data, vector data and generated data—all in one platform.
AI News: What future developments in database technology do you anticipate, and how is MongoDB preparing to support the next generation of AI applications?
Heloir: Our key values are the same today as they were when MongoDB initially launched: we want to make developers’ lives easier and help them drive business ROI. This remains unchanged in the age of artificial intelligence. We will continue to listen to our customers, assist them in overcoming their biggest difficulties, and ensure that MongoDB has the features they require to develop the next [generation of] great applications.

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

Photo By Ramsey Cardy / Sportsfile for Collision via Getty ImagesTwo scientists credited with laying the “foundation of today’s powerful machine learning,” University of Toronto professor emeritus Geoffrey Hinton and Princeton University professor John Hopfield, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics today.Their discoveries and inventions laid the groundwork for many of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Since the 1980s, their work has enabled the creation of artificial neural networks, computer architecture loosely modeled after the structure of the brain. By mimicking the way our brains make connections, neural networks allow AI tools to essentially “learn by example.” Developers can train an artificial neural network to recognize complex patterns by feeding it data, undergirding some of the most high-profile uses of AI today, from language generation to image recognition. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.”“I had no expectations of this. I am extremely surprised and I’m honoured to be included,” a “flabbergasted” Hinton said in a University of Toronto news release.Hinton, often called “The Godfather of AI,” told The New York Times last year that “a part of him ... now regrets his life’s work.” He reportedly left his post at Google in 2023 in order to be able to call attention to the potential risks posed by the technology he was instrumental in bringing to fruition. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton said in the NYT interview. In 2013, Google acquired Hinton’s neural networks company, which he started with two students, including Ilya Sutskever who would later become chief scientist at OpenAI before leaving this year.The Nobel committee recognized Hinton for developing what’s called the Boltzmann machine, a generative model, with colleagues in the 1980s:Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive development of machine learning.Hinton’s work builds on fellow awardee John Hopfield’s Hopfield network, an artificial neural network that can recreate patterns: The Hopfield network utilises physics that describes a material’s characteristics due to its atomic spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network as a whole is described in a manner equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in physics, and is trained by finding values for the connections between the nodes so that the saved images have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works through the nodes and updates their values so the network’s energy falls. The network thus works stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with.Hinton continues to raise his concerns with AI, including in a call today with reporters. “We have no experience of what it’s like to have things smarter than us. And it’s going to be wonderful in many respects,” he said. “But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.”CommentsMost PopularMost PopularGoogle must crack open Android for third-party stores, rules Epic judgeAnother major hurricane is approaching Florida, one of the most rapidly intensifying on recordData breach leaks SSNs of over 230,000 Comcast customersPersona director says making beautiful menus is ‘actually really annoying’Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn’t thinking too far aheadVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The risks behind the generative AI craze: Why caution is growing

As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
In the near future, Silicon Valley might look back at recent events as the point where the generative AI craze went too far.
This past summer, investors questioned whether top AI stocks could sustain their sky-high valuations, given the lack of returns on massive AI spending. As Autumn approaches, major AI sectors—such as chips, LLMs, and AI devices—received renewed confidence. Nonetheless, there are an increasing number of reasons to be cautious.
Cerebras: A chip contender with a major risk
Chip startup Cerebras is challenging Nvidia’s dominance by developing processors designed to power smarter LLMs. Nvidia, a major player in the AI boom, has seen its market cap skyrocket from $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion.
Cerebras, however, relies heavily on a single customer: the Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. In 2023, G42 accounted for 83% of Cerebras’ revenue, and in the first half of 2024, that figure increased to 87%. While G42 is backed by major players like Microsoft and Silver Lake, its dependency poses a risk. Even though Cerebras has signed a deal with Saudi Aramco, its reliance on one client may cause concerns as it seeks a $7-8 billion valuation for its IPO.
OpenAI’s record-breaking funding – but with strings attached
OpenAI made the news when it raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, becoming the largest investment round in Silicon Valley history. However, the company has urged its investors not to back competitors such as Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI—an unusual request in the world of venture capital, where spread betting is common. Critics, including Gary Marcus, have described this approach as “running scared.”
OpenAI’s backers also include “bubble chasers” such as SoftBank and Tiger Global, firms known for investing in companies at their peak, which frequently results in huge losses. With top executives such as CTO Mira Murati departing and predicted losses of $5 billion this year despite rising revenues, OpenAI faces significant challenges.
Meta’s big bet on AI wearables
Meta entered the AI race by unveiling Orion, its augmented reality glasses. The wearables promise to integrate AI into daily life, with Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang endorsing the product. However, at a production cost of $10,000 per unit, the price is a major obstacle.
Meta will need to reduce costs and overcome consumer hesitation, as previous attempts at AI-powered wearables—such as Snapchat’s glasses, Google Glass, and the Humane AI pin—have struggled to gain traction.
The road ahead
What’s next for AI? OpenAI must prove it can justify a $157 billion valuation while operating at a loss. Cerebras needs to reassure investors that relying on one client isn’t a dealbreaker. And Meta must convince consumers to adopt a completely new way of interacting with AI.
If these companies succeed, this moment could mark a turning point in the AI revolution. However, as tech history shows, high-stakes markets are rarely easy to win.

2024-10-09 20:39:50: task=Research Report: The Risks Behind the Generative AI Craze: Why Caution is Growing

Introduction:
The recent surge in generative AI has led to a growing concern about the risks associated with this technology. As investors and tech giants continue to pour money into AI startups, the industry is experiencing unprecedented growth. However, this rapid expansion has also raised concerns about the potential risks and consequences of this technology. This report aims to explore the risks behind the generative AI craze and why caution is growing.

Cerebras: A Chip Contender with a Major Risk
Cerebras, a chip startup, is challenging Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. While Cerebras has made significant progress, its heavy reliance on a single customer, G42, poses a significant risk. G42 accounted for 83% of Cerebras' revenue in 2023 and 87% in the first half of 2024. This dependency raises concerns about the company's ability to sustain itself in the long term.

OpenAI's Record-Breaking Funding – But with Strings Attached
OpenAI made headlines when it raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, becoming the largest investment round in Silicon Valley history. However, the company has urged its investors not to back competitors, which is an unusual request in the world of venture capital. Critics have described this approach as "running scared." Additionally, OpenAI's backers include "bubble chasers" such as SoftBank and Tiger Global, firms known for investing in companies at their peak, which frequently results in huge losses.

Meta's Big Bet on AI Wearables
Meta has entered the AI race by unveiling Orion, its augmented reality glasses. The wearables promise to integrate AI into daily life, but at a production cost of $10,000 per unit, the price is a major obstacle. Meta will need to reduce costs and overcome consumer hesitation, as previous attempts at AI-powered wearables have struggled to gain traction.

The Road Ahead
What's next for AI? OpenAI must prove it can justify a $157 billion valuation while operating at a loss. Cerebras needs to reassure investors that relying on one client isn't a dealbreaker. And Meta must convince consumers to adopt a completely new way of interacting with AI. If these companies succeed, this moment could mark a turning point in the AI revolution. However, as tech history shows, high-stakes markets are rarely easy to win.

Conclusion:
The generative AI craze has brought about unprecedented growth and investment in the AI industry. However, this rapid expansion has also raised concerns about the potential risks and consequences of this technology. Companies like Cerebras, OpenAI, and Meta are facing significant challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of this technology. As the industry continues to grow, it is essential to exercise caution and consider the potential risks associated with generative AI.2024-10-09 20:39:50: status=completed

It says its AI agents might someday be smart enough to buy you stuff without you even having to ask.FacebookXEmailSave StoryPhoto-Illustration: WIRED Staff/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveAmazon might not have ChatGPT, but it has a roadmap that includes developing even more advanced forms of artificial intelligence—including AI agents that are hell-bent on helping you buy stuff.The ecommerce company is already sprinkling ChatGPT-like AI over its website and apps—today announcing, among other enhancements, AI-generated shopping guides for hundreds of different product categories. Executives at the company say its engineers are also exploring more ambitious AI services, including autonomous AI shopping agents that recommend goods to a customer or even add items to their cart.“It’s on our roadmap. We’re working on it, prototyping it, and when we think it’s good enough, we’ll release it in whatever form makes sense,” says Trishul Chilimbi, a VP and distinguished scientist at Amazon who works on applying the company’s core AI to its products and services.Sign UpThis is an edition of WIRED's AI Lab newsletter by resident AI expert Will Knight. Get it in your inbox every week.Chilimbi says the first step toward AI agents will likely be chatbots that proactively recommend products based on what they know of your habits and interests, as well as a grasp of broader trends. He acknowledges that making this feel nonintrusive will be crucial. “If it’s no good and annoying, then you’ll tune it out,” he says. “But if it comes up with surprising things that are interesting, you’ll use it more.”Amazon added a chatbot called Rufus to its platform in February 2024 that can answer a wide range of questions about Amazon’s many products. The bot uses a bespoke large language model—the kind of algorithm that powers ChatGPT—also known as Rufus.The Rufus LLM is trained on vast amounts of internet text—like those on publicly available websites—and is then fine-tuned into a commerce-focused model by being fed a carefully curated diet of Amazon’s proprietary data. Chilimbi says Amazon’s LLM has “hundreds of billions of parameters.” (Parameters are a rough measure of capability; for comparison, Meta’s largest publicly available LLM has 405 billion.) He confirmed that Amazon is training a larger model, but declined to say how large it is or what capabilities Amazon hopes it will unlock.Like many tech companies, Amazon is looking beyond chat and turning its attention toward the potential of so-called agents, which use LLMs but attempt to carry out useful tasks on users’ behalf either by writing code on-the-fly, inputing text, or moving a computer’s cursor. Future AI agents might, for instance, navigate various websites to sort out a parking ticket, or they might operate a PC to file a tax return. Getting LLM-powered programs to do this reliably is elusive, however, because such tasks are vastly more complex than simple queries and require a new level of precision and reliability.“Every major company is now doing [AI] agents,” says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who is working on AI agents. The technology is exciting, he says, because it promises to automate countless routine tasks that people do every day: “On the ecommerce side, if agents can find the best possible outcome for me, that's amazing.”Salakhutdinov and colleagues at CMU developed a dummy ecommerce website as part of a platform called Visual Web Arena for testing AI agents. Key challenges include enabling agents to better make sense of visual information and training them to explore vast arrays of possible options while zooming in on the correct one—something that may require more advanced reasoning abilities.Most PopularGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuSecurityLicense Plate Readers Are Creating a US-Wide Database of More Than Just CarsBy Matt BurgessGearThe Best Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon HillGearThe Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for EveryoneBy Adrienne SoBut Salakhutdinov says that having a wealth of information about how users go about common and important tasks like shopping might be a crucial ingredient for getting them to stay on track. “Data is going to be very important,” he says.Ship ItAmazon’s agents are, of course, likely to be more focused on helping customers find and buy whatever they need or want. A Rufus agent might notice when the next book in a series someone is reading becomes available and then automatically recommend it, add it to your cart, or even buy it for you, says Rajiv Mehta, a vice president at Amazon who works on conversational AI shopping. “It could say, ‘We have one bought for you. We can ship it today, and it will arrive tomorrow morning at your door. Would you like that?’” Mehta says. He adds that Amazon is thinking about how advertising can be incorporated into its model's recommendation.Chilimbi and Mehta say that eventually, an agent might go on a shopping spree when a customer says, “I’m going on a camping trip, buy me everything I need.” An extreme, though not impossible, scenario would involve agents that decide for themselves when a customer needs something, and then buy and ship it to their door. “You could maybe give it a budget,” Chilimbi says with a grin.Amazon’s new AI-generated shopping guides, announced at its Reinvent conference in Nashville today and initially available on the company’s US mobile website and app, are a small step toward the ultimate vision of a superintelligent shopping assistant. The Rufus LLM is used to autogenerate the sort of information and insights that could take someone hours of online research to gather. “If you ever try to shop in a category you're not familiar with, it can be pretty time-consuming to understand the lay of the land, the different features available, and the different selections,” says Brett Canfield, a senior product manager on the personalization team at Amazon.Canfield showed WIRED shopping guides for televisions and earbuds that noted important technical features, explanations of key terminology, and, of course, recommendations on which products to buy. The underlying LLM has access to the vast corpus of product information, customer questions, reviews, and feedback, and users’ buying habits. “This is really only possible with generative AI,” Canfield says.The new shopping guides highlight generative AI’s potential in ecommerce, creating guides for product categories too niche to normally get the treatment. “The definitive hedge trimmers,” for instance.Guide SuppliesThe guides also, however, show how generative AI threatens to upend the economics of search and shopping while borrowing liberally from conventional publishers.AI-generated search results often now provide product comparisons and opinions. This diverts traffic from outlets, like WIRED, that make money by producing shopping guides, reviews, and other articles, even though the AI results are produced using data scraped from such websites in the first place.Canfield declines to say what additional training data was used to build the new AI shopping guide feature.

As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.
China Telecom, one of the country’s state-owned telecom giants, has created two LLMs that were trained solely on domestically-produced chips.
This breakthrough represents a significant step in China’s ongoing efforts to become self-reliant in AI technology, especially in light of escalating US limitations on access to advanced semiconductors for its competitors.
According to the company’s Institute of AI, one of the models, TeleChat2-115B and another unnamed model were trained on tens of thousands of Chinese-made chips. This achievement is especially noteworthy given the tighter US export rules that have limited China’s ability to purchase high-end processors from Nvidia and other foreign companies. In a statement shared on WeChat, the AI institute claimed that this accomplishment demonstrated China’s capability to independently train LLMs and signals a new era of innovation and self-reliance in AI technology.
The scale of these models is remarkable. China Telecom stated that the unnamed LLM has one trillion parameters. In AI terminology, parameters are the variables that help the model in learning during training. The more parameters there are, the more complicated and powerful the AI becomes.
Chinese companies are striving to keep pace with global leaders in AI based outside the country. Washington’s export restrictions on Nvidia’s latest AI chips such as the A100 and H100, have compelled China to seek alternatives. As a result, Chinese companies have developed their own processors to reduce reliance on Western technologies. For instance, the TeleChat2-115B model has approximately 100 billion parameters, and therefore can perform as well as mainstream platforms.
China Telecom did not specify which company supplied the domestically-designed chips used to train its models. However, as previously discussed on these pages, Huawei’s Ascend chips play a key part in the country’s AI plans.
Huawei, which has faced US penalties in recent years, is also increasing its efforts in the artificial intelligence field. The company has recently started testing its latest AI processor, the Ascend 910C, with potential clients waiting in the domestic market. Large Chinese server companies, as well as internet giants that have previously used Nvidia chips, are apparently testing the new chip’s performance. Huawei’s Ascend processors, as one of the few viable alternatives to Nvidia hardware, are viewed as a key component of China’s strategy that will lessen its reliance on foreign technology.
In addition to Huawei, China Telecom is collaborating with other domestic chipmakers such as Cambricon, a Chinese start-up specialising in AI processors. The partnerships reflect a broader tendency in China’s tech industry to build a homegrown ecosystem of AI solutions, further shielding the country from the effects of US export controls.
By developing its own AI chips and technology, China is gradually reducing its dependence on foreign-made hardware, especially Nvidia’s highly sought-after and therefore expensive GPUs. While US sanctions make it difficult for Chinese companies to obtain the latest Nvidia hardware, a black market for foreign chips has emerged. Rather than risk operating in the grey market, many Chinese companies prefer to purchase lower-powered alternatives such as previous-gen models to maintain access to Nvidia’s official support and services.
China’s achievement reflects a broader shift in its approach to AI and semiconductor technology, emphasising self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive global economy and in face of American protectionist trade policies.

While AI improves the detection of cybersecurity threats, it simultaneously ushers in more advanced challenges.
Research from Keeper Security finds that, despite the implementation of AI-related policies, many organisations remain inadequately prepared for AI-powered threats.
84% of IT and security leaders find AI-enhanced tools have exacerbated the challenge of detecting phishing and smishing attacks, which were already significant threats. In response, 81% of organisations have enacted AI usage policies for employees. Confidence in these measures runs high, with 77% of leaders expressing familiarity with best practices for AI security.
Gap between AI cybersecurity policy and threats preparedness
More than half (51%) of security leaders view AI-driven attacks as the most severe threat to their organisations. Alarmingly, 35% of respondents feel ill-prepared to address these attacks compared to other cyber threats.
Organisations are deploying several key strategies to meet these emerging challenges:
Data encryption: Utilised by 51% of IT leaders, encryption serves as a crucial defence against unauthorised access and is vital against AI-fuelled attacks.
Employee training and awareness: With 45% of organisations prioritising enhanced training programmes, there is a focused effort to equip employees to recognise and counter AI-driven phishing and smishing intrusions.
Advanced threat detection systems: 41% of organisations are investing in these systems, underscoring the need for improved detection and response to sophisticated AI threats.
The advent of AI-driven cyber threats undeniably presents new challenges. Nevertheless, fundamental cybersecurity practices – such as data encryption, employee education, and advanced threat detection – continue to be essential. Organisations must ensure these essential measures are consistently re-evaluated and adjusted to counter emerging threats.
In addition to these core practices, advanced security frameworks like zero trust and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions can bolster an organisation’s resilience.
Zero trust demands continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications, reducing the risk of unauthorised access and minimising potential damage during an attack. PAM offers targeted security for an organisation’s most sensitive accounts, crucial for defending against complex AI-driven threats that aim at high-level credentials.
Darren Guccione, CEO and Co-Founder of Keeper Security, commented: “AI-driven attacks are a formidable challenge, but by reinforcing our cybersecurity fundamentals and adopting advanced security measures, we can build resilient defences against these evolving threats.”
Proactivity is also key for organisations—regularly reviewing security policies, performing routine audits, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness are all essential.
While organisations are advancing, cybersecurity requires perpetual vigilance. Merging traditional practices with modern approaches like zero trust and PAM will empower organisations to maintain an edge over developing AI-powered threats.

2024-10-12 21:52:30: task=**Research Report: Many Organisations Unprepared for AI Cybersecurity Threats**

**Introduction**

The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought about significant benefits to various industries, but it has also introduced new cybersecurity challenges. As AI improves the detection of cybersecurity threats, it simultaneously ushers in more advanced challenges. This report highlights the findings of a study by Keeper Security, which reveals that many organisations remain inadequately prepared for AI-powered threats.

**Key Findings**

1. **Gap between AI cybersecurity policy and threats preparedness**: Despite the implementation of AI-related policies, many organisations are still unprepared for AI-powered threats. 84% of IT and security leaders find AI-enhanced tools have exacerbated the challenge of detecting phishing and smishing attacks.
2. **Lack of confidence in AI security measures**: 35% of respondents feel ill-prepared to address AI-driven attacks compared to other cyber threats. This lack of confidence is concerning, given the severity of AI-powered threats.
3. **Organisations' strategies to meet emerging challenges**: To counter AI-driven threats, organisations are deploying various strategies, including:
	* Data encryption (51% of IT leaders)
	* Employee training and awareness (45% of organisations)
	* Advanced threat detection systems (41% of organisations)

**Recommendations**

1. **Reinforce fundamental cybersecurity practices**: Organisations must ensure that essential measures, such as data encryption, employee education, and advanced threat detection, are consistently re-evaluated and adjusted to counter emerging threats.
2. **Adopt advanced security frameworks**: Zero trust and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions can bolster an organisation's resilience against AI-powered threats.
3. **Proactive approach**: Organisations must regularly review security policies, perform routine audits, and foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness to stay ahead of developing threats.

**Conclusion**

The advent of AI-driven cyber threats presents new challenges, but by reinforcing fundamental cybersecurity practices and adopting advanced security measures, organisations can build resilient defences against these evolving threats. Proactivity is key, and organisations must stay vigilant to maintain an edge over developing AI-powered threats.2024-10-12 21:52:30: status=completed

While AI improves the detection of cybersecurity threats, it simultaneously ushers in more advanced challenges.
Research from Keeper Security finds that, despite the implementation of AI-related policies, many organisations remain inadequately prepared for AI-powered threats.
84% of IT and security leaders find AI-enhanced tools have exacerbated the challenge of detecting phishing and smishing attacks, which were already significant threats. In response, 81% of organisations have enacted AI usage policies for employees. Confidence in these measures runs high, with 77% of leaders expressing familiarity with best practices for AI security.
Gap between AI cybersecurity policy and threats preparedness
More than half (51%) of security leaders view AI-driven attacks as the most severe threat to their organisations. Alarmingly, 35% of respondents feel ill-prepared to address these attacks compared to other cyber threats.
Organisations are deploying several key strategies to meet these emerging challenges:
Data encryption: Utilised by 51% of IT leaders, encryption serves as a crucial defence against unauthorised access and is vital against AI-fuelled attacks.
Employee training and awareness: With 45% of organisations prioritising enhanced training programmes, there is a focused effort to equip employees to recognise and counter AI-driven phishing and smishing intrusions.
Advanced threat detection systems: 41% of organisations are investing in these systems, underscoring the need for improved detection and response to sophisticated AI threats.
The advent of AI-driven cyber threats undeniably presents new challenges. Nevertheless, fundamental cybersecurity practices – such as data encryption, employee education, and advanced threat detection – continue to be essential. Organisations must ensure these essential measures are consistently re-evaluated and adjusted to counter emerging threats.
In addition to these core practices, advanced security frameworks like zero trust and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions can bolster an organisation’s resilience.
Zero trust demands continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications, reducing the risk of unauthorised access and minimising potential damage during an attack. PAM offers targeted security for an organisation’s most sensitive accounts, crucial for defending against complex AI-driven threats that aim at high-level credentials.
Darren Guccione, CEO and Co-Founder of Keeper Security, commented: “AI-driven attacks are a formidable challenge, but by reinforcing our cybersecurity fundamentals and adopting advanced security measures, we can build resilient defences against these evolving threats.”
Proactivity is also key for organisations—regularly reviewing security policies, performing routine audits, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness are all essential.
While organisations are advancing, cybersecurity requires perpetual vigilance. Merging traditional practices with modern approaches like zero trust and PAM will empower organisations to maintain an edge over developing AI-powered threats.
