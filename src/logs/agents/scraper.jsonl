Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: 'Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings', 'Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting', 'Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I'm invited', 'Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization', and 'Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings'.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

However, Meta\u2019s decision will prevent European companies from utilising this technology, potentially putting them at a disadvantage in the global AI race.\n\u201cWe will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,\u201d a Meta spokesperson stated.\nA text-only version of Meta\u2019s Llama 3 model is still expected to launch in the EU.\nMeta\u2019s announcement comes just days after the EU finalised compliance deadlines for its new AI Act. Tech companies operating in the EU will have until August 2026 to comply with rules surrounding copyright, transparency, and specific AI applications like predictive policing.\nThe withholding of these advanced AI models from the EU market creates a challenging situation for companies outside the region. Those hoping to provide products and services utilising these models will be unable to offer them in one of the world\u2019s largest economic markets.\nMeta plans to integrate its multimodal AI models into products like the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company\u2019s EU exclusion will extend to future multimodal AI model releases as well.\nMeta will *not* release the multimodal versions of its AI products and models in the EU because of an unpredictable regulatory environment. This means that EU users of Ray-Ban Meta won't be able to use the image understanding features.It also means that the EU industry will not\u2026\u2014 Yann LeCun (@ylecun) July 19, 2024\nAs more tech giants potentially follow suit, the EU may face challenges in maintaining its position as a leader in technological innovation while balancing concerns about AI\u2019s societal impacts.\n(Photo by engin akyurt)\nSee also: AI could unleash \u00a3119 billion in UK productivity\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

However, European customers and companies will be unable to access or utilise the technology.\n\"We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,\" a Meta spokesperson told Axios.\nThe decision highlights growing tensions between American tech firms and EU regulators. Last month, Apple made a similar move, withholding its Apple Intelligence features from Europe over regulatory concerns.\nMeta's primary issue stems from difficulties in training AI models using European user data while complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In June, the company was ordered to pause AI training on EU data after announcing plans to use public posts from Facebook and Instagram users.\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta's lead privacy regulator in Europe, said discussions with the company over model training were ongoing.\nDespite nearly identical data protection laws, Meta plans to launch the new model for UK users, citing less regulatory uncertainty in Britain.\nThe withholding of the multimodal AI model could have far-reaching implications for European businesses and consumers. Companies outside the EU may be prevented from offering products and services in Europe that utilise the new technology.\nMeta argues that training on European data is crucial for ensuring its products accurately reflect regional terminology and culture. The company claims competitors such as Google and OpenAI are already training on European data.\nWhile the multimodal model will be withheld, Meta still plans to release a larger, text-only version of its Llama 3 model in the EU.\nThe move underscores the ongoing struggle between innovation and regulation in the rapidly evolving field of AI, with European users potentially missing out on cutting-edge technologies as a result.\nShare Story:\nRecent Stories\nSamsung to acquire British AI startup Oxford Semantic\n READ STORY \nMeta withholds advanced AI model from EU amid regulatory uncertainty\n READ STORY \nAccenture acquires Logic to bolster retail tech arm\n READ STORY \nBringing Teams to the table \u2013 Adding value by integrating Microsoft Teams with business applicationsYour browser does not support HTML5 video.A decade ago, the idea of digital collaboration started and ended with sending documents over email.

She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.\nIn the fast-paced world of technology, missing the next big thing can be costly. For Intel, the semiconductor titan that once reigned supreme in the computer age, one such moment came and went quietly between 2017 and 2018. It was then that the company declined an opportunity that, in hindsight, appears to have been a golden ticket to the AI revolution.\nRecent\u00a0reports\u00a0reveal that Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. At the time, OpenAI was a fledgling non-profit focused on the then-obscure field of generative AI. Under CEO Bob Swan\u2019s leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns.\nThis decision reflects a broader challenge established tech giants face: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel\u2019s choice to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI showcases a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.\nFast forward to 2024, and the consequences of that decision are stark. OpenAI, now valued at around $80 billion, has become a driving force behind the AI revolution with its ChatGPT platform. Meanwhile, Intel is playing catch-up in the AI chip market, dwarfed by rival Nvidia\u2019s $2.6 trillion market cap and struggling to maintain relevance in an industry it once dominated.\nThis missed opportunity is not an isolated incident for Intel. The company declined to produce processors for Apple\u2019s iPhone,\u00a0closing\u00a0the door on Intel\u2019s entry into the mobile computing era. These missteps paint a picture of a once-innovative giant that has lost its ability to foresee and capitalize on transformative technologies.\nIntel\u2019s journey from industry leader to AI laggard is reflected in its recent financial performance. The company\u2019s market value has dipped below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years, and it recently announced plans to cut over 15% of its workforce following disappointing earnings. While Intel aims to launch its third-generation Gaudi AI chip later this year, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to regain ground in the fiercely competitive AI hardware market.\nThe OpenAI episode underscores a broader challenge facing established tech giants: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel\u2019s decision to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI reflects a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.\nAs AI continues to reshape industries and create new markets, the ability to identify and invest in groundbreaking technologies early will be crucial for tech companies hoping to maintain their competitive edge.

She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.\nIn the fast-paced world of technology, missing the next big thing can be costly. For Intel, the semiconductor titan that once reigned supreme in the computer age, one such moment came and went quietly between 2017 and 2018. It was then that the company declined an opportunity that, in hindsight, appears to have been a golden ticket to the AI revolution.\nRecent\u00a0reports\u00a0reveal that Intel had the chance to acquire a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, with the potential for an additional 15% stake in exchange for producing hardware at cost. At the time, OpenAI was a fledgling non-profit focused on the then-obscure field of generative AI. Under CEO Bob Swan\u2019s leadership, Intel ultimately passed on the deal, unconvinced that generative AI would yield near-term returns.\nThis decision reflects a broader challenge established tech giants face: balancing short-term financial considerations with long-term strategic investments in emerging technologies. Intel\u2019s choice to prioritize immediate returns over the potential of generative AI showcases a cautious approach that may have cost it dearly in the long run.\nFast forward to 2024, and the consequences of that decision are stark.

While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.The deal marks AMD\u2019s biggest acquisition since it bought Xilinx for $35bn in 2022.\u201cIt brings a thousand world-class design engineers into our team, it allows us to develop silicon and systems in parallel and, most importantly, get the newest AI infrastructure up and running in data centres as fast as possible,\u201d AMD\u2019s chief executive Lisa Su told the Financial Times. \u201cIt really helps us deploy our technology much faster because this is what our customers are telling us [they need],\u201d Su added.The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval, after which New Jersey-based ZT Systems will be folded into AMD\u2019s data centre business group. The $4.9bn valuation includes up to $400mn contingent on \u201ccertain post-closing milestones\u201d.Citi and Latham & Watkins are advising AMD, while ZT Systems has retained Goldman Sachs and Paul, Weiss.The move comes as AMD seeks to break Nvidia\u2019s stranglehold on the AI data centre chip market, which earlier this year saw Nvidia temporarily become the world\u2019s most valuable company as big tech companies pour billions of dollars into its chips to train and deploy powerful new AI models.Part of Nvidia\u2019s success stems from its \u201csystems\u201d approach to the AI chip market, offering end-to-end computing infrastructure that includes pre-packaged server racks, networking equipment and software tools to make it easier for developers to build AI applications on its chips.AMD\u2019s acquisition shows the chipmaker building out its own \u201csystems\u201d offering. The company rolled out its MI300 line of AI chips last year, and says it will launch its next-generation MI350 chip in 2025 to compete with Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell line of GPUs. In May, Microsoft was one of the first AI hyperscalers to adopt the MI300, building it into its Azure cloud platform to run AI models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. AMD\u2019s quarterly revenue for the chips surpassed $1bn for the first time in the three months to June 30.But while AMD has feted the MI300 as its fastest-ever product ramp, its data centre revenue still represented a fraction of the $22.6bn that Nvidia\u2019s data centre business raked in for the quarter to the end of April.RecommendedArtificial intelligence\u2018Most exciting moment\u2019 since birth of WiFi: chipmakers hail arrival of AI PCsIn March, ZT Systems announced a partnership with Nvidia to build custom AI infrastructure using its Blackwell chips. \u201cI think we certainly believe ZT as part of AMD will significantly accelerate the adoption of AMD AI solutions,\u201d Su said, but \u201cwe have customer commitments and we are certainly going to honour those\u201d.Su added that she expected regulators\u2019 review of the deal to focus on the US and Europe.In addition to increasing its research and development spending, AMD says it has invested more than $1bn over the past year to expand its AI hardware and software ecosystem. In July the company announced it was acquiring Finnish AI start-up Silo AI for $665mn, the largest acquisition of a privately held AI start-up in Europe in a decade.

While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.The deal marks AMD\u2019s biggest acquisition since it bought Xilinx for $35bn in 2022.\u201cIt brings a thousand world-class design engineers into our team, it allows us to develop silicon and systems in parallel and, most importantly, get the newest AI infrastructure up and running in data centres as fast as possible,\u201d AMD\u2019s chief executive Lisa Su told the Financial Times. \u201cIt really helps us deploy our technology much faster because this is what our customers are telling us [they need],\u201d Su added.The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval, after which New Jersey-based ZT Systems will be folded into AMD\u2019s data centre business group. The $4.9bn valuation includes up to $400mn contingent on \u201ccertain post-closing milestones\u201d.Citi and Latham & Watkins are advising AMD, while ZT Systems has retained Goldman Sachs and Paul, Weiss.The move comes as AMD seeks to break Nvidia\u2019s stranglehold on the AI data centre chip market, which earlier this year saw Nvidia temporarily become the world\u2019s most valuable company as big tech companies pour billions of dollars into its chips to train and deploy powerful new AI models.Part of Nvidia\u2019s success stems from its \u201csystems\u201d approach to the AI chip market, offering end-to-end computing infrastructure that includes pre-packaged server racks, networking equipment and software tools to make it easier for developers to build AI applications on its chips.AMD\u2019s acquisition shows the chipmaker building out its own \u201csystems\u201d offering. The company rolled out its MI300 line of AI chips last year, and says it will launch its next-generation MI350 chip in 2025 to compete with Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell line of GPUs. In May, Microsoft was one of the first AI hyperscalers to adopt the MI300, building it into its Azure cloud platform to run AI models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. AMD\u2019s quarterly revenue for the chips surpassed $1bn for the first time in the three months to June 30.But while AMD has feted the MI300 as its fastest-ever product ramp, its data centre revenue still represented a fraction of the $22.6bn that Nvidia\u2019s data centre business raked in for the quarter to the end of April.RecommendedArtificial intelligence\u2018Most exciting moment\u2019 since birth of WiFi: chipmakers hail arrival of AI PCsIn March, ZT Systems announced a partnership with Nvidia to build custom AI infrastructure using its Blackwell chips. \u201cI think we certainly believe ZT as part of AMD will significantly accelerate the adoption of AMD AI solutions,\u201d Su said, but \u201cwe have customer commitments and we are certainly going to honour those\u201d.Su added that she expected regulators\u2019 review of the deal to focus on the US and Europe.In addition to increasing its research and development spending, AMD says it has invested more than $1bn over the past year to expand its AI hardware and software ecosystem. In July the company announced it was acquiring Finnish AI start-up Silo AI for $665mn, the largest acquisition of a privately held AI start-up in Europe in a decade.

GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That\u2019s an 87% drop in price per year.)As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that\u2019s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies \u2014 which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures \u2014 I\u2019m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn\u2019t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour \u2013 which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries. So how can AI companies prepare?First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn\u2019t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices. Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities. Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details \u2014 specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I\u2019m optimistic that this will become easier.Keep learning!AndrewA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AIIn our short course \u201cLarge Multimodal Model Prompting with Gemini,\u201d you\u2019ll learn how to build systems that reason across text, images, and video and how prompting multimodal models differs from text-only LLMs. You\u2019ll also optimize LMM systems and output. Enroll today!NewsA Lost Voice RegainedA man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.What\u2019s new: Researchers built a system that decodes speech signals from the brain of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends, The New York Times reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.How it works: The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient\u2019s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. After the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.A gated recurrent unit (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. Given the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. A pretrained StyleTTS 2 text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient\u2019s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.Results: After two hours of recording the patient\u2019s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.Behind the news: Previous work either had much lower accuracy or generated a limited vocabulary. The new work improved upon a 2023 study that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. Why it matters: Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It\u2019s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors\u2019 system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient\u2019s former voice. We\u2019re thinking: Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.Agentic Coding Strides ForwardAn agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.What\u2019s new: Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model\u2019s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.How it works: Genie is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o with a larger context window of undisclosed size. It works similarly to agentic coding tools like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers\u2019 processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie\u2019s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.At inference \u2014 given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue \u2014 the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie\u2019s results don\u2019t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie\u2019s solution sets to verify its performance.)Behind the news: SWE-bench\u2019s creators recently collaborated with OpenAI to produce a new version, SWE-bench Verified. They eliminated extremely difficult and poorly configured problems, leaving 500 human-verified issue-commit pairs. Cosine has yet to publish Genie\u2019s performance on SWE-bench Verified. As of this writing, Amazon Q ranks in first place with 38.8 percent. Why it matters: Some developers of AI coding assistants train models to follow human-style procedures while others are building AI-native methods. Genie takes a distinct step forward by mimicking software engineers. Competition between the two approaches, along with longer context windows, faster inference, and increasingly sophisticated agentic workflows, is driving improvement of coding assistants at a rapid pace. We\u2019re thinking: We\u2019re glad this Genie escaped the bottle!AI Lobby ExpandsAI is a red-hot topic for lobbyists who aim to influence government policies in the United States.What\u2019s new: The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI jumped more than 20 percent in the first half of 2024, TechCrunch reported. Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.How it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs. More than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.OpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI\u2019s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That\u2019s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company\u2019s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it\u2019s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.Anthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.Cohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft each spent more than $10 million on lobbying in 2023, Time reported.Yes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don\u2019t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns. For instance, last year the American Medical Association spent $21.2 million on lobbying including AI but, given the wide range of policy issues involved in medicine, AI likely accounted for a small amount of the total. Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have"}

GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That\u2019s an 87% drop in price per year.)As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that\u2019s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies \u2014 which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures \u2014 I\u2019m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn\u2019t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour \u2013 which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries. So how can AI companies prepare?First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn\u2019t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices. Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities. Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details \u2014 specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I\u2019m optimistic that this will become easier.Keep learning!AndrewA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AIIn our short course \u201cLarge Multimodal Model Prompting with Gemini,\u201d you\u2019ll learn how to build systems that reason across text, images, and video and how prompting multimodal models differs from text-only LLMs. You\u2019ll also optimize LMM systems and output. Enroll today!NewsA Lost Voice RegainedA man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.What\u2019s new: Researchers built a system that decodes speech signals from the brain of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends, The New York Times reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.How it works: The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient\u2019s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. After the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.A gated recurrent unit (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. Given the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. A pretrained StyleTTS 2 text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient\u2019s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.Results: After two hours of recording the patient\u2019s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.Behind the news: Previous work either had much lower accuracy or generated a limited vocabulary. The new work improved upon a 2023 study that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. Why it matters: Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It\u2019s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors\u2019 system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient\u2019s former voice. We\u2019re thinking: Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.Agentic Coding Strides ForwardAn agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.What\u2019s new: Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model\u2019s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.How it works: Genie is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o with a larger context window of undisclosed size. It works similarly to agentic coding tools like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers\u2019 processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. Cosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). Subsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie\u2019s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.At inference \u2014 given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue \u2014 the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.Genie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.Results: Tested on SWE-bench Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie\u2019s results don\u2019t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie\u2019s solution sets to verify its performance.)Behind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.Why it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it\u2019s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions. That the army of AI lobbyists includes companies large and small as well as far-flung institutions, with varying degrees of direct involvement in building or using AI, reflects both the technology\u2019s power and the importance of this moment in charting its path forward.We\u2019re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it\u2019s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It\u2019s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.A graphic shows an any-to-any multimodal model, with text mapping to RGB or geometric modalities.Multimodal to the MaxResearchers introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.What\u2019s new: Roman Bachmann, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi and colleagues at EPFL and Apple built 4M-21, a system that works with 21 input and output types. These include modalities related to images, geometry, and text along with metadata and embeddings produced by other models.Key insight: The authors followed and extended their insight from the earlier 4M, which handles seven input and output types, as well as work such as Unified-IO 2, which handles 11. The key to training a model to handle multiple types of data input is to ensure that the training data takes the same format with the same-sized embedding across all input types. Using the transformer architecture, tokens suffice. How it works: 4M-21 comprises a large transformer and several encoder-decoders that convert different data types into tokens and back. The authors repeated their training strategy for 4M, but they increased the transformer\u2019s size from 303 million parameters to 3 billion parameters, boosted the training dataset size from 400 million examples to 500 million examples, and incorporated new input types. The authors started with RGB images and captions from CC12M and COYO700M plus text from C4.Using a variety of tools, they extracted depth images, surface-normal images, semantically segmented images, images of edges, graphics metadata, bounding boxes, color palettes, web text, image embeddings (feature maps and global embeddings), and text embeddings. For instance, they performed semantic segmentation using Mask2Former and SAM, and extracted edges using OpenCV and SAM, counting each output as a separate data type.They converted all input types into tokens. For image-like data types and image embeddings, they trained VQ-VAE to reconstruct images and, in doing so, represent images as tokens. For human poses and the embeddings from DINOv2 and ImageBind, they trained Bottleneck MLP to reconstruct them and thus learn to represent them as tokens. They produced tokens of sequence data including text and metadata using WordPiece.Given a random sample of tokens of all modalities, 4M-21 learned to predict a different random sample of tokens. The random samples were sometimes biased toward one modality and other times biased toward a more balanced sampling. To determine which tokens to"}

They eliminated extremely difficult and poorly configured problems, leaving 500 human-verified issue-commit pairs. Cosine has yet to publish Genie\u2019s performance on SWE-bench Verified. As of this writing, Amazon Q ranks in first place with 38.8 percent.\n\nWhy it matters: Some developers of AI coding assistants train models to follow human-style procedures while others are building AI-native methods. Genie takes a distinct step forward by mimicking software engineers. Competition between the two approaches, along with longer context windows, faster inference, and increasingly sophisticated agentic workflows, is driving improvement of coding assistants at a rapid pace.\n\nWe\u2019re thinking: We\u2019re glad this Genie escaped the bottle!\n\nAI Lobby Expands\nAI is a red-hot topic for lobbyists who aim to influence government policies in the United States.\n\nWhat\u2019s new: The number of organizations lobbying to influence U.S. laws and regulations that affect AI jumped more than 20 percent in the first half of 2024, TechCrunch reported. Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nHow it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs.\n\nMore than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.\n\nOpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI\u2019s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That\u2019s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company\u2019s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it\u2019s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.\n\nAnthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.\n\nCohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.\n\nYes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don\u2019t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns. For instance, last year the American Medical Association spent $21.2 million on lobbying including AI but, given the wide range of policy issues involved in medicine, AI likely accounted for a small amount of the total.\n\nBehind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.\n\nWhy it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it\u2019s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions.\n\nWe\u2019re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it\u2019s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology"}

GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023.  This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)17/12. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That\u2019s an 87% drop in price per year.)\nAs you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that\u2019s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.\nFurther, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive  114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new  offering), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.\nWhen building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies \u2014 which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures \u2014 I\u2019m confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.\nThis means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn\u2019t entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I  wrote  previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour \u2013 which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries. \nSo how can AI companies prepare?\nFirst, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn\u2019t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.\nSecond, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices. \nFinally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities. \nBecause multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details \u2014 specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). \nWhen switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the  difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I\u2019m optimistic that this will become easier.\nKeep learning!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM  DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn our short course \u201cLarge Multimodal Model Prompting with Gemini,\u201d you\u2019ll learn how to build systems that reason across text, images, and video and how prompting multimodal models differs from text-only LLMs. You\u2019ll also optimize LMM systems and output. \nEnroll today!\nNews\nA Lost Voice Regained\nA man who lost the ability to speak four years ago is sounding like his earlier self, thanks to a collection of brain implants and machine learning models.\nWhat\u2019s new:  Researchers built a system that  decodes speech signals from the brain  of a man who lost the ability to speak clearly due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS, and enables him to speak through a synthetic version of his former voice. At the start of the study, his efforts to speak were intelligible only to his personal caregiver. Now he converses regularly with family and friends,  The New York Times  reported. Nicholas Card built the system with colleagues University of California-Davis, Stanford University, Washington University, Brown University, VA Providence Healthcare, and Harvard Medical School.\nHow it works:  The authors surgically implanted four electrode arrays into areas of the brain that are responsible for speech. The system learned to decode the patient\u2019s brain signals, decide the most likely phonemes he intended to speak, determine the words those phonemes express, and display and speak the words aloud using a personalized speech synthesizer. \nAfter the patient recovered from the implantation surgery, the authors collected data for training and evaluating the system. They recorded his brain signals while he tried to speak during 84 sessions, each between 5 and 30 minutes, over 32 weeks. The sessions were split into two tasks: copying, in which the patient spoke sentences shown on a screen, and conversation, in which he spoke about whatever he wanted. Initial sessions focused on copying. Later, when the authors had accrued paired brain signals and known sentences, they focused on conversation.\nA  gated recurrent unit  (GRU) learned to translate brain signals into a sequence of phonemes. The authors trained the model after each session on all recordings made during that session. To adapt it to day-to-day changes in brain activity, they also fine-tuned it during later sessions: After they recorded a new sentence, they fine-tuned the GRU on a 60/40 mix of sentences from the current session and previous sessions.\nA weighted finite-state transducer (WFST), based on a pretrained 5-gram language model and described in the supplementary information  here), translated sequences of phonemes into sentences. Given a sequence, it generated the 100 most likely sentences. \nGiven the likely sentences, the authors ranked them according to the probability that the GRU, WFST, and  OPT, a pretrained large language model, would generate them. \n A pretrained  StyleTTS 2  text-to-speech model turned the highest-ranking sentence into speech. The authors fine-tuned the model on recordings of the patient\u2019s voice from before the onset of his illness, such as podcasts.\nResults:  After two hours of recording the patient\u2019s brain signals and training on that data, the system achieved 90.2 percent accuracy in the copying task. By the final session, the system achieved 97.5 percent accuracy and enabled the patient to speak on average 31.6 words per minute using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.\nBehind the news:  Previous work either had much  lower accuracy  or generated a  limited vocabulary . The new work improved upon a 2023  study  that enabled ALS patients to speak with 76.2 percent accuracy using a vocabulary of equal size. \nWhy it matters:  Relative to the 2023 study on which this one was based, the authors changed the positions of the electrodes in the brain and continued to update the GRU throughout the recording/training sessions. It\u2019s unclear which changes contributed most to the improved outcome. As language models improve, new models potentially could act as drop-in replacements for the models in the authors\u2019 system, further improving accuracy. Likewise, improvements in speech-to-text systems could increase the similarity between the synthetic voice and the patient\u2019s former voice. \nWe\u2019re thinking:  Enabling someone to speak again restores agency. Enabling someone to speak again in their own voice restores identity.\nAgentic Coding Strides Forward\nAn agentic coding assistant boosted the state of the art in an important benchmark by more than 30 percent.\nWhat\u2019s new:  Cosine, a startup based in London, unveiled  Genie, a coding assistant that achieves top performance on SWE-bench, which tests a model\u2019s ability to solve GitHub issues. The company has yet to announce pricing and availability, but a waitlist is available.\nHow it works:  Genie is a  fine-tuned version of GPT-4o  with a larger context window of  undisclosed  size. It works similarly to  agentic coding tools  like Devin, Q, OpenDevin, and SWE-agent. Its agentic workflow loops through four processes: retrieving information, planning, writing code, and running it. It was trained on a proprietary training set that captures software engineers\u2019 processes for reasoning, gathering information, and making decisions. It edits lines of code in place rather than rewriting entire sections or files from scratch. \nCosine initially fine-tuned Genie roughly equally on six software engineering tasks: developing features, fixing bugs, refactoring, making minor changes, writing tests, and writing documentation. The fine-tuning set included 15 programming languages, mostly JavaScript and Python (21 percent each) followed by TypeScript and TSX (14 percent each). \nSubsequent fine-tuning focused on finishing incomplete code and fixing imperfect code, which was underrepresented in the initial dataset. This round of training used incorrect examples generated by Genie itself. By comparing Genie\u2019s initial incorrect output with correct examples, the model improved its ability to recognize and fix mistakes.\nAt inference \u2014 given a prompt in natural language, a ticket that outlines a programming task, or a GitHub issue \u2014 the model retrieves relevant files and documentation, makes a plan for fixing the issue, and writes new code. After writing new code, it runs verification tests. If the tests fail, it loops between planning and coding until the tests succeed.\nGenie can also create and monitor pull requests on GitHub. It responds to human comments on its own pull requests just like it acts upon GitHub issues.\nResults:  Tested on  SWE-bench  Full (2,294 issue-commit pairs across 12 Python repositories), Genie solved 30.1 percent of problems, far ahead of the next closest competitor, Amazon Q, at 19.75 percent. Genie achieved 50.7 percent of the SWE-bench Lite (winnowed to 300 issue-commit pairs to save computation), beating CodeStory Aide plus other models at 43 percent. (Genie\u2019s results don\u2019t appear on the official SWE-bench leaderboard. The leaderboard requires that models document their workings, which Cosine declined to avoid revealing proprietary information. Cosine released Genie\u2019s  solution sets  to verify its performance.)\nBehind the news:  The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information  according to  the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration,  according to  BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would  regulate  AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.\nWhy it matters:  Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it\u2019s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions. That the army of AI lobbyists includes companies large and small as well as far-flung institutions, with varying degrees of direct involvement in building or using AI, reflects both the technology\u2019s power and the importance of this moment in charting its path forward.\nWe\u2019re thinking:  We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it\u2019s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It\u2019s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.\nA graphic shows an any-to-any multimodal model, with text mapping to RGB or geometric modalities.\nMultimodal to the Max\nResearchers introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.\nWhat\u2019s new:  Roman Bachmann, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi and colleagues at EPFL and Apple built  4M-21, a system that works with 21 input and output types. These include modalities related to images, geometry, and text along with metadata and embeddings produced by other models.\nKey insight:  The authors followed and extended their insight from the earlier  4M, which handles seven input and output types, as well as work such as  Unified-IO 2, which handles 11. The key to training a model to handle multiple types of data input is to ensure that the training data takes the same format with the same-sized embedding across all input types. Using the transformer architecture, tokens suffice. \nHow it works:  4M-21 comprises a large transformer and several encoder-decoders that convert different data types into tokens and back. The authors repeated their training strategy for 4M, but they increased the transformer\u2019s size from 303 million parameters to 3 billion parameters, boosted the training dataset size from 400 million examples to 500 million examples, and incorporated new input types. \nThe authors started with RGB images and captions from  CC12M  and  COYO700M  plus text from  C4.\nUsing a variety of tools, they extracted depth images, surface-normal images, semantically segmented images, images of edges, graphics metadata, bounding boxes, color palettes, web text, image embeddings (feature maps and global embeddings), and text embeddings. For instance, they performed semantic segmentation using  Mask2Former  and  SAM, and extracted edges"}

Data collected by OpenSecrets, which tracks political contributions, shows increased lobbying by startups including OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nHow it works: OpenSecrets searched for the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d in lobbying disclosure forms. Organizations must file such forms quarterly if they discuss specific laws and regulations with decision makers or their staffs.\n\nMore than 550 organizations lobbied the federal government about AI policy in the first half of 2024, up from 460 in 2023. These included tech giants and startups; venture capital firms; think tanks; companies and trade groups in various industries including insurance, health care, and education; and universities.\n\nOpenAI spent $800,000 on lobbying in the first half of the year, compared to $260,000 the previous year. OpenAI\u2019s team of contract lobbyists grew to 15, including former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman. That\u2019s up from three in 2023, when it hired its first internal lobbyist. In addition, the company\u2019s global affairs department expanded to 35 people; it\u2019s expected to balloon to 50 by the end of the year. OpenAI publicly supports legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate that would appoint a National AI Research Resource program manager and authorize an AI Safety Institute to set national standards and create public datasets.\n\nAnthropic expanded its team of external lobbyists from three to five this year and hired an in-house lobbyist. It expects to spend $500,000 on lobbying as the election season heats up.\n\nCohere budgeted $120,000 for lobbying this year after spending $70,000 last year.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft each spent more than $10 million on lobbying in 2023, Time reported.\n\nYes, but: The lobbying disclosure forms show who is spending money to influence policy, but they provide only a limited view. For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don\u2019t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns.\n\nBehind the news: The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 400 state laws are also under consideration, according to BSA, a software lobbying group, including California SB-1047, which would regulate AI models whose training exceeds a particular threshold of computation. Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.\n\nWhy it matters: Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it\u2019s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions.\n\nWe\u2019re thinking: We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it\u2019s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It\u2019s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.\n\nA graphic shows an any-to-any multimodal model, with text mapping to RGB or geometric modalities.\n\nMultimodal to the Max"}

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nChinese internet search provider Baidu has updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.\nThis change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.\nAccording to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike\u2019s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.\nThis action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, like Reddit, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.\nAccording to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.\nSuch a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine\u2019s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was inked with the Financial Times in April.\nBaidu\u2019s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.\nAs the AI industry continues to evolve, it\u2019s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.\n(Photo by Kelli McClintock)\nSee also: Google advances mobile AI in Pixel 9 smartphones\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nChinese internet search provider Baidu has updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.\nThis change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.\nAccording to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike\u2019s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.\nThis action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, like Reddit, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.\nAccording to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.\nSuch a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine\u2019s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was inked with the Financial Times in April.\nBaidu\u2019s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.\nAs the AI industry continues to evolve, it\u2019s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.\n(Photo by Kelli McClintock)\nSee also: Google advances mobile AI in Pixel 9 smartphones\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nOpenAI has announced the release of fine-tuning capabilities for its GPT-4o model, a feature eagerly awaited by developers. To sweeten the deal, OpenAI is providing one million free training tokens per day for every organisation until 23rd September.\nTailoring GPT-4o using custom datasets can result in enhanced performance and reduced costs for specific applications. Fine-tuning enables granular control over the model\u2019s responses, allowing for customisation of structure, tone, and even the ability to follow intricate, domain-specific instructions.\nDevelopers can achieve impressive results with training datasets comprising as little as a few dozen examples. This accessibility paves the way for improvements across various domains, from complex coding challenges to nuanced creative writing.\n\u201cThis is just the start,\u201d assures OpenAI, highlighting their commitment to continuously expand model customisation options for developers.\nGPT-4o fine-tuning is available immediately to all developers across all paid usage tiers. Training costs are set at 25 per million tokens, with inference priced at 3.75 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.\nOpenAI is also making GPT-4o mini fine-tuning accessible with two million free daily training tokens until 23rd September.\u00a0 To access this, select \u201cgpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\u201d from the base model dropdown on the fine-tuning dashboard.\nThe company has collaborated with select partners to test and explore the potential of GPT-4o fine-tuning:\nCosine\u2019s Genie, an AI-powered software engineering assistant, leverages a fine-tuned GPT-4o model to autonomously identify and resolve bugs, build features, and refactor code alongside human developers.\u00a0 By training on real-world software engineering examples, Genie has achieved a state-of-the-art score of 43.8% on the new SWE-bench Verified benchmark, marking the largest improvement ever recorded on this benchmark.\nDistyl, an AI solutions provider, achieved\u00a0 first place on the BIRD-SQL benchmark after fine-tuning GPT-4o. This benchmark, widely regarded as the leading text-to-SQL test, saw Distyl\u2019s model achieve an execution accuracy of 71.83%, demonstrating superior performance across demanding tasks such as query reformulation and SQL generation.\nOpenAI reassures users that fine-tuned models remain entirely under their control, with complete ownership and privacy of all business data. This means no data sharing or utilisation for training other models.\nStringent safety measures have been implemented to prevent misuse of fine-tuned models. Continuous automated safety evaluations are conducted, alongside usage monitoring, to ensure adherence to OpenAI\u2019s robust usage policies.\n(Photo by Matt Artz)\nSee also: Primate Labs launches Geekbench AI benchmarking tool\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

This increasing demand has resulted in the rise of AI-powered content writing tools, raising concerns from human writers about their future in this market. Can AI tools and human writers coexist in the online space? Could they complement each other? The answer is yes, if humans embrace AI\u2019s strengths and counteract its inherent weaknesses.\n\nEfficiency and productivity\n\nAs someone who has worked in the content industry for over a decade, I have been taken aback by AI\u2019s ability to streamline the content creation process. AI can quickly produce large swathes of content based on predefined parameters such as keyword density, readability, and tone. The speed at which AI-powered writing tools perform is staggering, making them perfect for creating large volumes of content, such as blog posts, product descriptions, and even social media updates.\n\nHowever, AI-generated content often lacks the creativity and depth that only human writers bring to the table. For example, an AI tool like Google\u2019s Gemini or ChatGPT could easily write a detailed review of the online sportsbook MyBookie filled with details. Yet it would be impossible for those tools to give a personalised anecdote about their interaction with customer support, the ease of depositing and withdrawing, or similar. People want facts, but they also want a personal touch, which makes content engaging and relatable.\n\nIdea generation and research\n\nAll AI-powered tools excel at analysing huge amounts of data and identifying opportunities, trends, and patterns, which makes AI writing tools an invaluable asset for idea generation and research. I lean on AI for help in this area because although I specialise in gaming-related content, many of my clients request articles about unfamiliar subjects.\n\nLast week, I wrote an article about NASCAR racing despite only knowing these stock cars race around an oval track. I asked ChatGPT for several ideas for NASCAR-related articles and to provide statistics from some of the best-known drivers and teams. The tool almost instantly came back with several potential topics and a plethora of data, which I then delved deeper into while bringing originality to my article that AI cannot replicate.\n\nCustomisation and personalisation\n\nAI-powered writing tools also shine when it comes to producing content from user data, enabling a business to create and publish content with tailored messages to different segments of an audience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to create personalised product descriptions or social media posts that appeal to specific demographics.\n\nHowever, as mentioned in our previous paragraphs, while AI can personalise content based on data, it lacks the authenticity and emotional connection human writers provide. Humans can add personal touches to make the content feel genuine or adjust the tone to reflect the brand\u2019s tone of voice. Such intricacies and finishing touches help to create an authentic and consistent experience for the reader.\n\nQuality control and editing\n\nI said earlier that I often use AI-powered tools for idea generation and research, but I also use AI during quality control and editing. You may write an article packed with stellar content that you are proud of, only to discover upon publishing that it is strewn with spelling and grammatical errors.\n\nGrammarly Premium costs me approximately $150 annually, but it is worth its weight in gold. This powerful editing tool analyses my text for grammatical errors, sentence structure, and readability while providing easy-to-understand suggestions for improvement. Such a tool helps me to produce cleaner and more polished content without the need for extensive editing.\n\nHowever, although Grammarly is perfect for handling basic quality control, my human touch is still essential for the final review. This is especially true when writing an article with technical terms, jargon, or slang because the AI tool is often unaware of such words or phrases and incorrectly flags them as mistakes.\n\nCombining AI and human editing ensures my content is coherent, correct, and engaging.\n\nScalability\n\nAI can quickly and efficiently produce hundreds or thousands of pieces of content in a short period of time. This incredible scalability makes AI writing tools valuable for e-commerce sites, marketing agencies, or even new outlets that demand a constant flow of fresh content. However, while AI can easily scale production, human writers must ensure that AI-generated content is high quality and creative.\n\nAI-generated content can quickly become formulaic, generic, and repetitive without human input. One only needs to scour the internet for a few minutes before stumbling across a website where AI has mass-produced the site\u2019s content. Every article starts similarly, has the same structure, and has content drier than the Gobi Desert! Such websites probably enjoy plenty of traffic from new visitors. Still, I would be willing to bet my bottom dollar that their returning visitors figures are rock bottom because the content lacks engagement and is boring; you can\u2019t put a price on a returning customer\u2019s loyalty.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear that AI-powered writing tools are not going away. Indeed, they will become more prevalent, if anything. While human writers have valid reasons to be concerned about their future in the content creation industry, they should learn to leverage the power of AI to improve their content.\n\nHuman writers can let AI handle the heavy lifting of data processing, research, and even content generation (to some degree), freeing up priceless time for them to be creative and to add elements of flair and personality to the AI-generated work.\n\nIn its current guise, AI is a human writer\u2019s powerful and efficient ally; it is not a legitimate threat. Humans and AI can coexist in the content creation world until AI develops the ability to make up believable stories or think like only a human can. Such a time will likely never happen during our lifetimes.\n\n... (rest of the content)\"\n\nNote: The provided URL contains a lot of extra content, such as sidebars, menus, and footer information.

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nAmazon is gearing up to roll out a revamped version of its Alexa voice assistant, which is expected to be available this October, right before the US shopping rush.\nInternally referred to as \u201cRemarkable,\u201d the new technology will be powered by Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI models. Sources close to the matter have indicated that this shift occurred due to the underperformance of Amazon\u2019s in-house software.\nThe enhanced Alexa will operate using advanced generative AI to handle more complex queries. Amazon plans to offer the new Alexa as a subscription service, priced between $5 and $10 per month, while the classic version of Alexa will remain free. This approach marks a significant change for Amazon and suggests that the company aims to turn this voice assistant into a profitable venture after years of limited success in generating revenue through this platform.\nAmazon\u2019s decision to quickly adopt an external model, Claude, indicates a strategic shift. Amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimise its dependence on third-party vendors, thereby avoiding external influences on customer behaviour and business strategies, as well as external influences on who controls data. However, it seems that Amazon\u2019s traditional strategy does not provide the massive AI capability needed, or perhaps Amazon has realised the need for more powerful AI. It is also worth noting that the involved AI developer, OpenAI, is affiliated with major technology companies like Apple and Microsoft in developing AI technologies.\nThe launch of the \u201cRemarkable\u201d Alexa is anticipated during Amazon\u2019s annual devices and services event in September, though the company has not confirmed the exact date. This event will also mark the first public appearance of Panos Panay, the new head of Amazon\u2019s devices division, who has taken over from long-time executive David Limp.\nThe updated version of Alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant, as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. The assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people\u2019s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. The most likely features include personalised shopping advice, news aggregation, and more advanced home automation. As for whether customers would pay for Alexa, this likely depends on the final set of available features. The issue might be particularly pressing for Amazon, given that customers already pay for Prime membership.\nThe future for Alexa is quite ambitious, but it also bears significant risks. For the new version to be successful, internal performance benchmarks must be met. While estimates for \u201cRemarkable\u201d Alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for Amazon, the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.\nHowever, Amazon\u2019s partnership with Anthropic is currently under regulatory review, largely due to an investigation by the UK\u2019s antitrust regulator. The impending upgrade announcement and the regulator\u2019s response could significantly influence the company\u2019s future activities.\nAmazon\u2019s initiative to adopt an AI solution developed by Anthropic marks a significant shift for the company, which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology. At this point, it is possible to view this move as part of the general trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding AI development to enhance the competitiveness of products.\nSee also: Amazon strives to outpace Nvidia with cheaper, faster AI chips\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

It is also worth noting that the involved AI developer, OpenAI, is affiliated with major technology companies like Apple and Microsoft in developing AI technologies.\nThe launch of the \u201cRemarkable\u201d Alexa is anticipated during Amazon\u2019s annual devices and services event in September, though the company has not confirmed the exact date. This event will also mark the first public appearance of Panos Panay, the new head of Amazon\u2019s devices division, who has taken over from long-time executive David Limp.\nThe updated version of Alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant, as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. The assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people\u2019s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. The most likely features include personalised shopping advice, news aggregation, and more advanced home automation. As for whether customers would pay for Alexa, this likely depends on the final set of available features. The issue might be particularly pressing for Amazon, given that customers already pay for Prime membership.\nThe future for Alexa is quite ambitious, but it also bears significant risks. For the new version to be successful, internal performance benchmarks must be met. While estimates for \u201cRemarkable\u201d Alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for Amazon, the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.\nHowever, Amazon\u2019s partnership with Anthropic is currently under regulatory review, largely due to an investigation by the UK\u2019s antitrust regulator. The impending upgrade announcement and the regulator\u2019s response could significantly influence the company\u2019s future activities.\nAmazon\u2019s initiative to adopt an AI solution developed by Anthropic marks a significant shift for the company, which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology.

Not content with its existing capabilities, Musk stated, \u201cover the next couple of months, it will double in size, bringing it to 200k (50k H200s).\u201d\nThis weekend, the @xAI team brought our Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online. From start to finish, it was done in 122 days. Colossus is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Moreover, it will double in size to 200k (50k H200s) in a few months. Excellent\u2026\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2024\nThe scale of Colossus is unprecedented, surpassing every other cluster to date. For context, Google uses 90,000 GPUs while OpenAI utilises 80,000 GPUs\u2014both of which have been surpassed by xAI\u2019s creation, even prior to Colossus\u2019 doubling in size over the coming months.\nHere is a comparison chart to help everyone understand the magnitude of this. pic.twitter.com/PJys0XlvYo\u2014 Anthony Everywhere (@AnthonyEveryWhr) September 2, 2024\nDeveloped in partnership with Nvidia, Colossus leverages some of the most advanced GPU technology on the market. The system initially employs Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips, with plans to incorporate the newer H200 model in its expansion. This vast array of processing power positions Colossus as the most formidable AI training system currently available.\nThe H200, while recently superseded by Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip unveiled in March 2024, remains a highly sought-after component in the AI industry. It boasts impressive specifications, including 141 GB of HBM3E memory and 4.8 TB/sec of bandwidth. However, the Blackwell chip raises the bar even further, with top-end capacity 36.2% higher than the H200 and a 66.7% increase in total bandwidth.\nNvidia\u2019s response to the Colossus unveiling was one of enthusiasm and support. The company congratulated Musk and the xAI team on their achievement, highlighting that Colossus will not only be the most powerful system of its kind but will also deliver \u201cexceptional gains\u201d in energy efficiency.\nExciting to see Colossus, the world\u2019s largest GPU #supercomputer, come online in record time. Colossus is powered by @nvidia's #acceleratedcomputing platform, delivering breakthrough performance with exceptional gains in #energyefficiency.Congratulations to the entire team! https://t.co/UXHtPCELly\u2014 NVIDIA Data Center (@NVIDIADC) September 2, 2024\nColossus\u2019 processing power could potentially accelerate breakthroughs in various AI applications, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving algorithms. However, the unveiling of Colossus also reignites discussions about the concentration of AI power among a handful of tech giants and well-funded startups.\nAs companies like xAI push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in AI training, concerns about the accessibility of such advanced technologies to smaller organisations and researchers may come to the forefront.\nAs the AI arms race continues to heat up, all eyes will be on xAI and its competitors to see how they leverage these increasingly powerful systems. With Colossus, Musk and his team have thrown down the gauntlet and issued a challenge to rivals to match or exceed their efforts.\nSee also: Amazon partners with Anthropic to enhance Alexa\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The company was working to demonstrate its progress in artificial intelligence following a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. It added an AI powered chatbot into its Bing search engine, which placed it among the first legacy tech companies to fold AI into its flagship products, but almost as soon as people started using it, things went sideways.A New York Times journalist sparked international intrigue over a conversation he had with Bing that left him \"deeply unsettled\". Soon, users began sharing screenshots that appeared to show the tool using racial slurs and announcing plans for world domination. Microsoft quickly announced a fix, limiting the AI's responses and capabilities. In the following months, the company replaced its Bing chatbot with Copilot, which is now available as part of its Microsoft 365 software and Windows operating system.Microsoft is far from the only company to face AI controversy, and critics say the debacle is evidence of broader carelessness around the dangers of artificial intelligence within the tech industry. For example, Google's Bard tool famously answered a question about a telescope inaccurately during a live press demo, a mistake that wiped $100bn (\u00a382bn) off the company's value. The AI model, now called Gemini, later came under fire for \"woke\" bias after the tool seemed unwilling to produce images of white people for certain prompts.Getty ImagesCopilot \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s AI chatbot \u2013 is now available as part of Microsoft 365 software and the Windows operating system (Credit: Getty Images)Still, Microsoft says AI can be a tool to promote equity and representation \u2013 with the right safeguards. One solution it's putting forward to help address the issue of bias in AI is increasing diversity and inclusion of the teams building the technology itself.\u00a0 \u00a0\"It's never been more important as we think about building inclusive AI and inclusive tech for the future,\" says Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft's chief diversity officer, who joined the firm in 2018.A former teacher for the deaf, McIntyre has spent over 20 years in human resources in the tech industry, including at IBM, and has lived and worked throughout the US as well as in Singapore and Dubai. Now, she says her team at Microsoft is increasingly focused on embedding inclusion practices into the firm's AI research and development to make sure there is better representation \"at all levels of the company\".There's good reason for this focus. Embracing AI products has brought new life to the nearly 50-year-old brand. In July, the company reported revenue for the year was up 15% to $64.7 billion (\u00a349.2 billion), due largely to growth from its Azure cloud business, which has greatly benefited from the AI boom as customers train their systems on the platform.The efforts also push the company closer to its long-time goal to build technology \"that understands us\", as its CEO Satya Nadella recently put it. But in order for AI \u2013 or more specifically large-language models such as ChatGPT \u2013 to be empathic, relevant and accurate, McIntyre says, they needs to be trained by a more diverse group of developers, engineers and researchers.This may not be a guaranteed fix. The large language models that underpin tools such as Copilot, ChatGPT and Gemini are built by scraping massive data sets from across the internet. If bias is present in the training data, it's exceedingly difficult to stop it from cropping up later, which is of particular concern as artificial intelligence is used out in the real world.Getty ImagesMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella says embracing AI is helping push the company towards its goal of building technology \u201cthat understands us\u201d (Credit: Getty Images)Companies are embracing tools to help with hiring, for example, but experts warn they can reinforce race and gender biases as they filter candidates. Recent research from MIT found that AI interpreted professions such as \"flight attendant\", \"secretary\", and \"physician's assistant\" as feminine jobs, while \"fisherman\", \"lawyer\", and \"judge\" were deemed masculine jobs. It also labelled emotions including \"anxious\", \"depressed\" and \"devastated\" as feminine. Meanwhile, some US police departments have begun using AI to write up crime reports.Still, Microsoft believes that AI can support diversity and inclusion (D&I) if these ideals are built into AI models in the first place. The company maintains that inclusion has always been a large part of its culture, from the Xbox Adaptive Controller designed for users with special needs to the many accessibility features in its Microsoft 365 products. But the pressure to keep up with the pace and scale at which AI is growing is intensifying Microsoft's need to invest in its own diversity.In its 2023 diversity report, Microsoft reported about 54.8% of its core workforce is made up of racial and ethnic minorities, which is in line in part to rivals such as Apple and Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft's workforce is 31.2% women, down a few percentage points compared to Apple and Google.Below, McIntrye talks with the BBC about addressing biases in generative AI, how inclusive allyship looks across different cultures, and what Microsoft is doing to ensure its own talent can keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.MicrosoftLindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer, says her team is focused on embedding inclusion practices into the firm\u2019s AI research (Credit: Microsoft)How is Microsoft addressing bias in generative AI that afflicts these types of tools? We do a tremendous amount of investment [around this] but we also thread education on elements like bias and inclusion generally through all the work that we do.Microsoft believes AI technologies should perform fairly. We are continuing to invest in research on identifying, measuring and mitigating different types of fairness-related harms, and we are innovating in new ways to proactively test our AI systems, as outlined in our Responsible AI Standard. To do this, Microsoft works with a wide array of experts, including anthropologists, linguists and social scientists \u2013 all of whom bring valuable perspectives to the table that advance and challenge the thinking of our engineers and developers.To develop and deploy AI systems responsibly, we are putting D&I at the centre by ensuring a wide range of backgrounds, skills and experiences are represented across the Microsoft teams that are envisioning and building AI so that it's developed in a way that's inclusive of all users. We also ensure our leaders who are making the decisions about these teams and products have the tools to understand issues of privilege, power and bias.Microsoft received backlash this summer following headlines around cutting its diversity and inclusion team. The company later clarified the team remained intact. Has there been a change to the company's commitment here?We are really fortunate Microsoft's commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering and unchanged. We're expanding. In that news cycle, I was reminded of how many people are depending on Microsoft to have inclusive tech, to make sure that we are continuing to stay on the forefront of the diversity and inclusion experiences, to share our learnings and to listen to how other people are experiencing this same moment in the industry. Not because we know more than anybody else \u2013 because for sure we don't, we're learning all the time \u2013 but we do have resources that not all companies have.More like this:\u2022 Why Zoom wants you to go back to the office\u2022 Lego CEO on the business case for play\u2022 EY exec: Neurodiverse talent benefits everyoneAre there any other focus areas when it comes to AI and inclusivity?One that is pretty dynamic is [making AI accessible] in more languages. When you're operating in a language different from your primary language, your brain has to work harder and you're less productive and less able to be your true authentic self. There's a real ongoing opportunity in AI to be even more thoughtful and relevant on the totality of global language. It's an enormous task, but we\u2019re learning so much every day and the AI is just getting smarter.Beyond AI, we did a partnership with external organisations who support the LGBTQ+ communities and our own employee resource group about adding pronouns to user profiles in Microsoft 365. [This allows people] to feel seen, recognised and cared for in the technology, which is the experience we want them to have.How do you help a workforce of 230,000 understand allyship when it looks different in various cultures?We have a core strategy but also localise it. In India, for example, we just ran a D&I experience at the intersection of race, ethnicity and religion for managers and leaders. Through feedback, we were also able to have Copilot pop up with responses that are both qualitative and quantitative so that we can be more effective as we deploy it to the whole of the workforce.We're also doing that in Australia and New Zealand for the indigenous communities. And in the Middle East and Africa, we wanted more support for employees and their families who are going through menopause \u2013 something that isn't always talked about in cultures around the world. \u00a0We also have to think about something as simple as the devices and the languages people are using, along with the accessibility features. Everyone wants an empathetic AI that is knowledgeable and relevant. We want to feel like the AI understands us and what we're trying to achieve. So, being able to have cultural context in the AI experience will result in a more satisfied experience \u2013 and those expectations that we put on the technology ultimately come from having a diverse workforce working on and building and creating the AI from the beginning.Microsoft by the numbers:228,000: Microsoft\u2019s global headcount190: Number of countries in which Microsoft operates9: Global employee-led resource groups that foster an inclusive workplace5 billion+: Number of chats and images generated through Copilot to date60,000+: Azure AI cloud customers building AI into their apps and servicesHow do you make sure talent doesn't get left behind as AI is evolving? We have an incredible AI learning hub that allows us to access the latest and greatest learnings\u2026 and the employee resource group is doing upskilling, leveraging some of the content to even teach themselves. Whether they are an engineer or a field seller or a program manager, we offer AI [courses]to help make us more productive \u2013 even those of us in HR. We have a huge HR team that's focused on how to leverage AI for the HR experience at Microsoft.How is Microsoft leveraging AI in HR? For example, Copilot is helping us get back to employees with questions faster. We are also deploying AI skilling courses, so all employees have a shared understanding of AI technology as we use it more and more in our work across business areas.For any organisation considering how to bring AI into HR work, there are three strategies to consider. First, form a community of learning with experts to build acumen together. Get curious with the technology, such as engaging with Copilot to learn how it can help you build inclusion in your organisation. And finally, ensure a human-centred design that puts empathy and people experience at the centre.--If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Executive loungeArtificial intelligenceBusinessDiversityTechnologyFeaturesWatchTesting out smart swim goggles for the Paris GamesA new generation of smart goggles provide real time visual feedback to enhance athletic performance.16 Aug 2024TechnologyLess is more: Can degrowth save the world?The degrowth movement questions the feasibility of the idea of endless economic growth on a finite planet.3 Aug 2024BusinessAI v The Mind: Can AI tell better jokes than a human?In a clash of wit and technology, we bring together two unlikely adversaries: a comedian and an AI chatbot.26 Jul 2024Artificial IntelligenceHow technology will power the opening ceremonyA new network along the Seine in Paris will broadcast Olympic festivities from the river.18 Jul 2024TechnologyWhy Olympic venues are using digital twinsA peak inside\u00a0both the real and virtual new Aquatic Centre built for the Paris Games.17 Jul 2024TechnologyWatch the movie that rewrites itselfFilmmaker Gary Hustwit has created a documentary which can rewrite itself before every screening.7 Jun 2024Artificial IntelligenceWhite gold rush: Harvesting lithium from Great Salt LakeCould the United States' largest saltwater lake hold the key to its energy future?13 May 2024TechnologyWhy are scientists making 'moon dust'?Space agencies around the world need lunar soil.10 May 2024InnovationWhere do your old mobile phones and TVs go to die?Dandora sits on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, and 800 tonnes of garbage is dumped on the site every day.3 May 2024TechnologyAI v The Mind: Who has the edge?In a new series, we will test the limits of the latest AI technology by pitting it against human experts.1 May 2024Artificial IntelligenceHow AI and deepfakes are changing politicsSome politicians have found themselves victims of deepfakes.

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nGoogle DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.\nAlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.\nThe system\u2019s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:\n(Credit: Google DeepMind)\nTrained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.\nTo validate AlphaProteo\u2019s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.\nFor instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo\u2019s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.\nThe system\u2019s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNF\u0251 (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)\nTo ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices\u2014including the NTI\u2019s new AI Bio Forum.\nAs the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.\nWhile AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.\nNevertheless, Google DeepMind\u2019s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.\nYou can find the full AlphaProteo whitepaper here (PDF)\nSee also: Paige and Microsoft unveil next-gen AI models for cancer diagnosis\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nGoogle DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.\nAlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.\nThe system\u2019s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:\n(Credit: Google DeepMind)\nTrained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.\nTo validate AlphaProteo\u2019s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.\nFor instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo\u2019s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.\nThe system\u2019s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNF\u0251 (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)\nTo ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices\u2014including the NTI\u2019s new AI Bio Forum.\nAs the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.\nWhile AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.\nNevertheless, Google DeepMind\u2019s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.\nYou can find the full AlphaProteo whitepaper here (PDF)\nSee also: Paige and Microsoft unveil next-gen AI models for cancer diagnosis\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nGoogle DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.\nAlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.\nThe system\u2019s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:\n(Credit: Google DeepMind)\nTrained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank and over 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.\nTo validate AlphaProteo\u2019s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.\nFor instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo\u2019s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.\nThe system\u2019s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNF\u0251 (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)\nTo ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices\u2014including the NTI\u2019s new AI Bio Forum.\nAs the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.\nWhile AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.\nNevertheless, Google DeepMind\u2019s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.\nYou can find the full AlphaProteo whitepaper here (PDF)\nSee also: Paige and Microsoft unveil next-gen AI models for cancer diagnosis\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nThe UK has signed a landmark AI safety treaty aimed at protecting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law from potential threats posed by the technology.\nLord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood signed the Council of Europe\u2019s AI convention today as part of a united global approach to managing the risks and opportunities. \n\u201cArtificial intelligence has the capacity to radically improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of public services, and turbocharge economic growth,\u201d said Lord Chancellor Mahmood.\n\u201cHowever, we must not let AI shape us\u2014we must shape AI. This convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law.\u201d\nThe treaty acknowledges the potential benefits of AI \u2013 such as its ability to boost productivity and improve healthcare \u2013 whilst simultaneously addressing concerns surrounding misinformation, algorithmic bias, and data privacy. It will compel signatory nations to monitor AI development, implement strict regulations, and actively combat any misuse of the technology that could harm public services or individuals.\nKeiron Holyome, VP UKI & Emerging Markets at BlackBerry, commented: \u201cTo truly outrun cybercriminals and maintain a defensive advantage, robust frameworks for AI governance and ethical standards must be established, ensuring responsible use and mitigating risks.\n\u201cThe first legally binding international AI treaty is another step towards such recommendations for both AI caution and applications for good. Collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and academia will be increasingly essential for sharing knowledge, developing best practices, and responding to emerging threats collectively.\u201d\nCrucially, the convention acts as a framework to enhance existing legislation in the UK. For example, aspects of the Online Safety Act will be bolstered to better address the risk of AI systems using biased data to generate unfair outcomes. \nThe agreement focuses on three key safeguards:\nProtecting human rights: Ensuring individuals\u2019 data is used responsibly, their privacy is respected, and AI systems are free from discrimination. \nProtecting democracy: Requiring countries to take proactive steps to prevent AI from being used to undermine public institutions and democratic processes.\nProtecting the rule of law: Placing an obligation on signatory countries to establish robust AI-specific regulations, shield their citizens from potential harm, and ensure responsible AI deployment.\nWhile the convention initially focuses on Council of Europe members, other nations \u2013 including the US and Australia \u2013 are being invited to join this international effort to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. \nPeter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, commented: \u201cAI holds the potential to be the driving force behind new economic growth, a productivity revolution and true transformation in our public services, but that ambition can only be achieved if people have faith and trust in the innovations which will bring about that change.\n\u201cThe convention we\u2019ve signed today alongside global partners will be key to that effort. Once in force, it will further enhance protections for human rights, rule of law, and democracy\u2014strengthening our own domestic approach to the technology while furthering the global cause of safe, secure, and responsible AI.\u201d\nThe UK Government has pledged to collaborate closely with domestic regulators, devolved administrations, and local authorities to ensure seamless implementation of the treaty\u2019s requirements once it is ratified.\nThe signing of the convention builds on the UK\u2019s previous efforts in responsible AI by hosting the AI Safety Summit and co-hosting the AI Seoul Summit, as well as establishing the world\u2019s first AI Safety Institute. \nSee also: UK adjusts AI strategy to navigate budget constraints\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

This convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law.\u201d\nThe treaty acknowledges the potential benefits of AI \u2013 such as its ability to boost productivity and improve healthcare \u2013 whilst simultaneously addressing concerns surrounding misinformation, algorithmic bias, and data privacy. It will compel signatory nations to monitor AI development, implement strict regulations, and actively combat any misuse of the technology that could harm public services or individuals.\nKeiron Holyome, VP UKI & Emerging Markets at BlackBerry, commented: \u201cTo truly outrun cybercriminals and maintain a defensive advantage, robust frameworks for AI governance and ethical standards must be established, ensuring responsible use and mitigating risks.\n\u201cThe first legally binding international AI treaty is another step towards such recommendations for both AI caution and applications for good. Collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and academia will be increasingly essential for sharing knowledge, developing best practices, and responding to emerging threats collectively.\u201d\nCrucially, the convention acts as a framework to enhance existing legislation in the UK. For example, aspects of the Online Safety Act will be bolstered to better address the risk of AI systems using biased data to generate unfair outcomes. \nThe agreement focuses on three key safeguards:\nProtecting human rights: Ensuring individuals\u2019 data is used responsibly, their privacy is respected, and AI systems are free from discrimination. \nProtecting democracy: Requiring countries to take proactive steps to prevent AI from being used to undermine public institutions and democratic processes.\nProtecting the rule of law: Placing an obligation on signatory countries to establish robust AI-specific regulations, shield their citizens from potential harm, and ensure responsible AI deployment.\nWhile the convention initially focuses on Council of Europe members, other nations \u2013 including the US and Australia \u2013 are being invited to join this international effort to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.   \nPeter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, commented: \u201cAI holds the potential to be the driving force behind new economic growth, a productivity revolution and true transformation in our public services, but that ambition can only be achieved if people have faith and trust in the innovations which will bring about that change.\n\u201cThe convention we\u2019ve signed today alongside global partners will be key to that effort. Once in force, it will further enhance protections for human rights, rule of law, and democracy\u2014strengthening our own domestic approach to the technology while furthering the global cause of safe, secure, and responsible AI.\u201d\nThe UK Government has pledged to collaborate closely with domestic regulators, devolved administrations, and local authorities to ensure seamless implementation of the treaty\u2019s requirements once it is ratified.\nThe signing of the convention builds on the UK\u2019s previous efforts in responsible AI by hosting the AI Safety Summit and co-hosting the AI Seoul Summit, as well as establishing the world\u2019s first AI Safety Institute. \nSee also: UK adjusts AI strategy to navigate budget constraints\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.\n\nJust three months after its inception, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a new AI startup founded by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, has raised $1 billion in funding. Led by venture capital firms Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, the latest investment round values the company at approximately $5 billion, according to a Financial Times report.\n\nSutskever, who left OpenAI in May this year following a failed attempt to oust CEO Sam Altman, established SSI to develop \u2018safe\u2019 AI models. The company\u2019s mission is to create AI systems that are both highly capable and aligned with human interests.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve identified a new mountain to climb that is slightly different from what I was working on previously. We\u2019re not trying to go down the same path faster. If you do something different, it becomes possible for you to do something special, Sutskever told the Financial Times.\n\nThe substantial funding will be used to acquire computing resources necessary for AI model development and to expand SSI\u2019s current team of 10 employees. The company actively recruits and offers positions in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nWith its focus on safety and alignment, SSI\u2019s approach differs from that of other AI companies. Take firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which are all developing AI models for various consumer and business applications. SSI, on the other hand, is focusing solely on creating what it calls a \u2018straight shot to safe superintelligence\u2019.\n\nDaniel Gross, SSI\u2019s chief executive, emphasised the importance of this focused approach in a statement to Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to be surrounded by investors who understand, respect and support our mission, which is to make a straight shot to safe superintelligence and in particular to spend a couple of years doing R&D on our product before bringing it to market.\u201d\n\nIt is also interesting to point out that despite not having a product yet, the company\u2019s significant valuation and funding highlight the intense interest and investment in safe AI research. This is amid growing concerns about the potential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems.\n\nEven Sutskever\u2019s departure from OpenAI was reportedly due to disagreements over the company\u2019s direction and the pace of AI development. At OpenAI, he led the \u2018alignment\u2019 team, which focused on ensuring that advanced AI systems would act in humanity\u2019s best interests.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that the formation of SSI and its rapid funding success reflect a broader trend in the AI industry towards addressing safety concerns alongside capability advancements. This approach aligns with calls from AI researchers and ethicists for more responsible development of artificial intelligence.\n\nToday, SSI joins a competitive field of well-funded AI companies. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise funds at a valuation exceeding $100 billion, while Anthropic and xAI were recently valued at around $20 billion.\n\nHowever, the crowded market did not dim SSI\u2019s unique focus on safety or its high-profile founding team, both of which have clearly resonated with investors.\n\n\u201cWe are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world\u2019s best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and nothing else. We offer an opportunity to do your life\u2019s work and help solve our age\u2019s most important technical challenge,\u201d the company\u2019s website states.\n\nFor now, the company\u2019s progress will be closely watched by both the tech industry and those concerned with the ethical implications of AI development.\""}

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nSony Research and AI Singapore (AISG) will collaborate on research for the SEA-LION family of large language models (LLMs).\nSEA-LION, which stands for Southeast Asian Languages In One Network, aims to improve the accuracy and capability of AI models when processing languages from the region. This is particularly important given the linguistic diversity of Southeast Asia, which is home to over a thousand different languages. \n\u201cAs a global company, diversity and localisation are vital forces,\u201d said Hiroaki Kitano, President of Sony Research. \u201cIn Southeast Asia specifically, there are more than a thousand different languages spoken by the citizens of the region. This linguistic diversity underscores the importance of ensuring AI models and tools are designed to support the needs of all populations around the world.\u201d\nThe collaboration will focus on testing and improving the SEA-LION model, with a particular emphasis on Tamil, a language spoken by an estimated 60-85 million people worldwide. Sony Research will leverage its expertise in Indian languages \u2013 including Tamil \u2013 and its research in speech generation, content analysis, and recognition.\n\u201cAccess to LLMs that address the global landscape of language and culture has been a barrier to driving research and developing new technologies that are representative and equitable for the global populations we serve,\u201d Kitano added.\nThe collaboration is further strengthened by Kitano\u2019s existing ties to the Singaporean technology landscape. He holds positions on numerous advisory councils and boards in the country, including the Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), and the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF).\n\u201cThe integration of the SEA-LION model, with its Tamil language capabilities, holds great potential to boost the performance of new solutions,\u201d Teo continued. \u201cWe are particularly eager to contribute to the testing and refinement of the SEA-LION models for Tamil and other Southeast Asian languages, while also sharing our expertise and best practices in LLM development.\n\u201cWe look forward to seeing how this collaboration will drive innovation in multilingual AI technologies.\u201d\n(Photo by James Lee)\nSee also: Whitepaper dispels fears of AI-induced job losses\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nFears that AI will lead to mass job losses are unfounded, according to a new whitepaper. The report, released by British AI software firm Automated Analytics, found that none of its 5,000 clients across the UK and US reported laying off staff as a result of AI implementation. \nThe whitepaper, titled \u201cUnlocking Data, Unlocking People: Harnessing the Power of AI to Transform Your Business,\u201d launched today at Scale Space White City in London\u2019s White City Innovation District. It argues that AI can actually be a catalyst for growth, rather than a threat to jobs.\nDespite evidence to the contrary, the study also reveals a lingering fear of AI among UK business leaders. \nA YouGov survey commissioned by Automated Analytics found that over half of senior decision-makers still believe AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates. Only 17% believe AI will create more jobs than it eliminates. \nThis hesitancy, the report warns, could have serious consequences for the UK economy. As US firms increasingly embrace AI, British businesses risk being left behind. Mark Taylor, CEO of Automated Analytics, argues that the UK needs to shift its focus from regulation to innovation in order to remain competitive.\n\u201cAI is not about replacing jobs; it\u2019s about enhancing productivity and creating new opportunities,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cOur whitepaper provides concrete examples of how AI can drive growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. The UK cannot afford to lag behind in this critical area.\u201d\nThe whitepaper highlights several case studies demonstrating the positive impact of AI on businesses:\nBritish Gas\u2019 Dyno-Rod: AI helped to halve the number of service calls by improving understanding of customer journeys, providing franchise operations with 100% visibility.\nPizza Hut (US): Restaurant Management Group, the fourth-largest US franchisee, used AI to reduce recruitment costs by $1 million and increase hires by 42%.\nFourth (UK): The hospitality recruitment firm saw a 220% increase in candidate flow and a drastic reduction in cost-per-application within 30 days of implementing its AI-driven TalentTrack software.\nTaylor also expressed concern over the cultural differences between the US and UK in embracing new technologies. \n\u201cThe US is leading the charge in AI adoption, while the UK remains overly focused on regulation. This whitepaper demonstrates that many fears surrounding AI are unfounded and that it can play a crucial role in driving the UK\u2019s economic growth.\u201d\nThe whitepaper serves as a call to action for UK businesses to embrace AI as a vital tool for driving innovation and competitiveness in the global market. While it\u2019s clear that businesses must adopt AI responsibly, the whitepaper should help to dispel fears of mass job losses.\nA copy of the whitepaper can be found here (registration required.)\n(Photo by Ruthson Zimmerman)\nSee also: UK signs AI safety treaty to protect human rights and democracy\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider. Sep 12, 2024, 5:05 PM UTCShare this story Image: The VergeOpenAI is releasing a new model called o1, the first in a planned series of \u201creasoning\u201d models that have been trained to answer more complex questions, faster than a human can. It\u2019s being released alongside o1-mini, a smaller, cheaper version. And yes, if you\u2019re steeped in AI rumors: this is, in fact, the extremely hyped Strawberry model.For OpenAI, o1 represents a step toward its broader goal of human-like artificial intelligence. More practically, it does a better job at writing code and solving multistep problems than previous models. But it\u2019s also more expensive and slower to use than GPT-4o. OpenAI is calling this release of o1 a \u201cpreview\u201d to emphasize how nascent it is.ChatGPT Plus and Team users get access to both o1-preview and o1-mini starting today, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all the free users of ChatGPT but hasn\u2019t set a release date yet. Developer access to o1 is really expensive: In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens, or chunks of text parsed by the model, and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For comparison, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens.The training behind o1 is fundamentally different from its predecessors, OpenAI\u2019s research lead, Jerry Tworek, tells me, though the company is being vague about the exact details. He says o1 \u201chas been trained using a completely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it.\u201d Image: OpenAIOpenAI taught previous GPT models to mimic patterns from its training data. With o1, it trained the model to solve problems on its own using a technique known as reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. It then uses a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to process queries, similarly to how humans process problems by going through them step-by-step.As a result of this new training methodology, OpenAI says the model should be more accurate. \u201cWe have noticed that this model hallucinates less,\u201d Tworek says. But the problem still persists. \u201cWe can\u2019t say we solved hallucinations.\u201dThe main thing that sets this new model apart from GPT-4o is its ability to tackle complex problems, such as coding and math, much better than its predecessors while also explaining its reasoning, according to OpenAI.\u201cThe model is definitely better at solving the AP math test than I am, and I was a math minor in college,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, tells me. He says OpenAI also tested o1 against a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, and while GPT-4o only correctly solved only 13 percent of problems, o1 scored 83 percent.\u201cWe can\u2019t say we solved hallucinations\u201dIn online programming contests known as Codeforces competitions, this new model reached the 89th percentile of participants, and OpenAI claims the next update of this model will perform \u201csimilarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry and biology.\u201dAt the same time, o1 is not as capable as GPT-4o in a lot of areas. It doesn\u2019t do as well on factual knowledge about the world. It also doesn\u2019t have the ability to browse the web or process files and images. Still, the company believes it represents a brand-new class of capabilities. It was named o1 to indicate \u201cresetting the counter back to 1.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest: I think we\u2019re terrible at naming, traditionally,\u201d McGrew says. \u201cSo I hope this is the first step of newer, more sane names that better convey what we\u2019re doing to the rest of the world.\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to demo o1 myself, but McGrew and Tworek showed it to me over a video call this week. They asked it to solve this puzzle: \u201cA princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is twice as old as the prince was when the princess\u2019s age was half the sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and princess? Provide all solutions to that question.\u201dThe model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a correct answer. OpenAI has designed the interface to show the reasoning steps as the model thinks. What\u2019s striking to me isn\u2019t that it showed its work \u2014 GPT-4o can do that if prompted \u2014 but how deliberately o1 appeared to mimic human-like thought. Phrases like \u201cI\u2019m curious about,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking through,\u201d and \u201cOk, let me see\u201d created a step-by-step illusion of thinking. But this model isn\u2019t thinking, and it\u2019s certainly not human. So, why design it to seem like it is?Phrases like \u201cI\u2019m curious about,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking through,\u201d and \u201cOk, let me see\u201d create a step-by-step illusion of thinking. Image: OpenAIOpenAI doesn\u2019t believe in equating AI model thinking with human thinking, according to Tworek. But the interface is meant to show how the model spends more time processing and diving deeper into solving problems, he says. \u201cThere are ways in which it feels more human than prior models.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019ll see there are lots of ways where it feels kind of alien, but there are also ways where it feels surprisingly human,\u201d says McGrew. The model is given a limited amount of time to process queries, so it might say something like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m running out of time, let me get to an answer quickly.\u201d Early on, during its chain of thought, it may also seem like it\u2019s brainstorming and say something like, \u201cI could do this or that, what should I do?\u201dBuilding toward agentsLarge language models aren\u2019t exactly that smart as they exist today. They\u2019re essentially just predicting sequences of words to get you an answer based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data. Take ChatGPT, which tends to mistakenly claim that the word \u201cstrawberry\u201d has only two Rs because it doesn\u2019t break down the word correctly. For what it\u2019s worth, the new o1 model did get that query correct.As OpenAI reportedly looks to raise more funding at an eye-popping $150 billion valuation, its momentum depends on more research breakthroughs. The company is bringing reasoning capabilities to LLMs because it sees a future with autonomous systems, or agents, that are capable of making decisions and taking actions on your behalf. For AI researchers, cracking reasoning is an important next step toward human-level intelligence. The thinking is that, if a model is capable of more than pattern recognition, it could unlock breakthroughs in areas like medicine and engineering. For now, though, o1\u2019s reasoning abilities are relatively slow, not agent-like, and expensive for developers to use.\u201cWe have been spending many months working on reasoning because we think this is actually the critical breakthrough,\u201d McGrew says. \u201cFundamentally, this is a new modality for models in order to be able to solve the really hard problems that it takes in order to progress towards human-like levels of intelligence.\u201dCommentsMost PopularMost PopularThe entire staff of beloved game publisher Annapurna Interactive has reportedly resignedOpenAI releases o1, its first model with \u2018reasoning\u2019 abilitiesThe US finally takes aim at truck bloatiFixit made its own USB-C soldering iron, and it\u2019s already a joyPhone sex hotline accidentally featured in 'The Last of\u00a0Us'Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

She worked as an emergency department doctor for more than a decade and spent six years as an evacuation doctor.\nAnne\u2019s previous positions include Chief Medical Officer at Cigna Healthcare, Allianz, Henner and Europe Assistance.\n\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve seen remarkable achievements across AI-assisted cancer diagnosis as more and more clinicians test, use and integrate AI companions into daily practice.\nSkin cancer is no exception, and we expect AI diagnostic tools to be widely implemented across this clinical arena in the future. What does AI assistance look like for skin cancer? A 2024 study led by researchers at Stanford Medicine compared the performance of clinicians diagnosing at least one skin cancer with and without deep learning-based AI assistance. In an experimental environment, clinicians without AI assistance achieved an average sensitivity of 74.8% while for AI-assisted clinicians, sensitivity was around 81.1%.\nWhat\u2019s intriguing is AI helped medical professionals at all levels, with the largest improvement seen among non-dermatologists.\n\nAI for skin cancer can impact behaviour change\nCancer is on the rise among younger people. According to a study published in BMJ Oncology,\u00a0the number of under-50s worldwide being diagnosed with cancer has risen by nearly 80% in three decades. And, over the last decade melanoma skin cancer incidence rates have increased by almost two-fifths\u00a0(38%) with Spain seeing a steady incidence increase of 2.4% during this time.\nIf detected early enough, skin cancer is easily treated and prognosis is very good. But busy lives and competing concerns mean fewer people are getting checked out, resulting in delays to diagnosis and treatment, which is dramatically changing the survival rates. Those who do, often wait to speak to a doctor. In fact, new research from Bupa, Attitudes Towards Digital Healthcare, indicates only 9% of people would immediately go to get a mole they were concerned about examined by a professional.\nHowever, the same research found that if people were able to have a mole assessed by an AI-powered phone app at the time of their choosing, that percentage increases more than threefold (33%). This signifies emerging technology can have a significant impact on positive behaviour change in healthcare and improve clinical outcome of a potentially severe disease.\n\nBupa now offer an at-home dermatology tool\nAt Bupa, we see lots of opportunities to use AI and are exploring its use to enhance patient care, improve operational efficiency, and help our customers to live longer, healthier and happier lives. We know that people want their healthcare partner to be by their side, not just when they are sick, but supporting them constantly to keep them well.\nThat\u2019s why we launched Blua, our digital healthcare service that\u2019s available in over 200 countries. Blua provides access to three lifechanging healthcare innovations that drive convenience and accessibility. They are virtual consultations so that a customer can connect to a health professional from wherever they choose. Digital health programmesthat allow customers to proactively manage their health and remote healthcare services such as prescription delivery and at home monitoring equipment. \u00a0\nFor customers in Spain, we offer an at-home dermatology assessment service through Blua. How does this work? Customers who\u2019re worried about a skin lesion can take high resolution photos of it using their smartphone. Once taken, the photos are uploaded to Blua and using AI are compared with a database of millions of other images of skin lesions to check for signs of malignancy.\nThe tool\u2019s algorithms are able to discern between 302 different skin pathologies. If the tool suspects that there is a cause for concern it will let the customer know to book a follow up appointment with a doctor so that it can be looked at further and preventative action can be taken if needed.\nThe future of healthcare means early detection\nDigital healthcare, together with AI, is going to play a crucial role in removing the barriers that stop people from getting health concerns like moles checked out in a timely manner, promoting positive behaviour change that can save lives. This is why Blua is especially useful in today\u2019s fast-paced world where convenience is paramount and virtual consultations and at home tests will empower individuals to prioritise their health, without the need to sacrifice their time.\u00a0\n\n(Photo by Nsey Benajah)\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?\u00a0Check out\u00a0AI & Big Data Expo\u00a0taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The funding was led by Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, and Radical Ventures. World Labs aims to develop AI technology that understands the 3D physical world, with potential applications in AR/VR and robotics.ETtechFei-Fei Li, a leading artificial intelligence researcher, has raised $230 million for a startup she and three colleagues founded to make AI technology that can understand how the three-dimensional physical world works, the company said on Friday. Initial funding for World Labs was led jointly by Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates and Radical Ventures. Other investors included AMD Ventures, Intel Capital and Nvidia's NVentures. World Labs declined to share its valuation. Li made her name in AI by developing ImageNet, a large-scale image dataset that helped usher in a generation of computer vision technologies that could identify objects reliably for the first time.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories Reuters previously reported that Li was working in stealth mode on an AI startup that could render ideas into 3D environments. World Labs' other founders are computer vision researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner and Ben Mildenhall. While commercially available generative AI models can produce dazzling text and photo outputs, Worlds Labs focuses on \"spatial intelligence,\" or the ability to reason how the 3D world works, Li told Reuters. Spatial intelligence models could be used in the future for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) or robotics, she said. \"The images and videos that you have seen so far coming out of generative AI models do not give you enough of the whole sense of how a 3D world is built,\" Li said in an interview, along with Mildenhall. This sense is fundamental to unlocking broader reasoning capabilities in AI systems, she noted. This would avoid the rendering of \"hallucinations\" like hands with the wrong number of fingers. \"The way we understand the structure of the world, imagined or real, will fundamentally be a piece of this AI puzzle,\" Li said. The San Francisco-based startup, with 20 employees, will train foundation models that its founders refer to as \"large world models\" or \"LWMs.\" Li said a combination of synthetic and real-world data will be used to train the models. The models will use the same transformer-based architecture that serves as the basis for OpenAI's viral ChatGPT chatbot, Li said. However, the transformer would not be the \"be-all and end-all\" of their models, she said, suggesting they will incorporate other elements as well. Li will continue her work at Stanford University's Human-Centered AI Institute while building the startup. World Labs is Li's second go-around in entrepreneurship. As a Princeton University student, Li borrowed money to buy a dry cleaning business for her parents and spent her weekends working there, she said in her memoirs.

Taylor Swift performs in Glendale, Ariz., on March 17, 2023. Kevin Winter / Getty Images file Aug. 19, 2024, 7:02 PM UTCBy Kat TenbargeOn Sunday night, Donald Trump shared a series of images on Truth Social appearing to show Taylor Swift fans wearing T-shirts that read \u201cSwifties for Trump.\u201d Among the images was a mock \u201cUncle Sam\u201d poster with Swift\u2019s face that said, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d Trump wrote: \u201cI accept!\u201d While two of the images Trump shared feature a real woman who supports Trump, most of the women depicted there aren\u2019t real. At least 15 of them are representations of people created using artificial intelligence.The images Trump shared had originally been posted on X by highly followed pro-Trump accounts. One of those accounts also posted multiple guides to using generative AI tools on its Substack blog. In a reply on X, the same account acknowledged that the images Trump reposted from them were AI-generated.\u00a0The new images are part of a social media campaign that some pro-Trump accounts spearheaded over the weekend trying to suggest that more and more fans of Swift, who endorsed Biden and harshly criticized Trump in 2020, are turning to support Trump. In reality, there is little evidence this is the case for a notable number of Swift\u2019s fans, who are called \u201cSwifties.\u201d\u201cThere is no Swifties For Trump movement \u2014 but there should be,\u201d wrote one of the accounts that Trump reposted on Truth Social in a caption on the AI-generated images.Other pro-Trump accounts have also shared AI-generated images that falsely depict Democrat-leaning voter blocs, like Black voters, supporting Trump.\u00a0Two of the images Trump shared on Sunday were of real people and featured a Liberty University college student who had a political communications internship this summer, according to her LinkedIn account. Her \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d social media content flew under the radar with fewer than 1,000 views until large pro-Trump accounts, and then Trump himself, shared it.\u00a0The same pro-Trump accounts have also reshared TikToks from women who say they are Swift fans and are voting for Trump, in an effort to promote the idea that Swifties are mobilizing en masse to support Trump. But these videos received far fewer views on TikTok than they did when Trump and his highly followed supporters reshared them.Representatives for Trump\u2019s campaign and Swift didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Swift has yet to endorse any candidate in 2024, but some of her fans have mobilized to support Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he was not running for re-election in July, a group called \u201cSwifties for Kamala\u201d launched on social media. It has more than 61,000 followers on X and is not affiliated with the singer or Harris.\u201cWe do not represent every Swiftie, but I think there is a reason we don\u2019t need AI to show our support for Kamala,\u201d the organization\u2019s co-founder, Irene Kim, told NBC News in a statement.\u00a0AI-generated images and videos of Swift have repeatedly gone viral this year, from sexually suggestive ones that broke X\u2019s platform guidelines to other ones that falsely identified Swift as a Trump supporter.\u00a0Throughout his presidential term and his campaigns, Trump has repeatedly shared inflammatory memes created by his\u00a0 online supporters. Up until 2021 he shared them on Twitter, but after he was banned from the platform that year, he has shared them on his own Twitter copycat platform, Truth Social. Trump has since returned to posting on X, with an uptick starting Aug. 12, the day he was interviewed by Elon Musk on the platform. Over the weekend, Trump posted a fake image of Harris standing in front of a communist symbol on both X and Truth Social.\u00a0It\u2019s not yet clear if the Sunday post or the images violate certain laws around publicity, likeness and AI. In March, Swift\u2019s home state of Tennessee passed updated legislation to protect the unauthorized use of someone\u2019s likeness with AI. While the account that acknowledged the photos were AI-generated labeled them as satire, the account that first published the \u201cUncle Sam\u201d poster using Swift\u2019s likeness did not.\u00a0David Greene, the civil liberties director and senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told NBC News that this situation, which is not exclusive to AI-generated content,\u00a0 could overlap with publicity laws that protect people from unauthorized commercial use of their likenesses.\u201cThis is probably a stronger case than many others because false endorsement is at the heart of those claims, though we typically see that in terms of product endorsements,\u201d Greene wrote in an email. \u201cThis was just good old low-tech lying.\u201dKat TenbargeKat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance\u00a9\u00a02024 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo]"}

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Sep 12, 2024, 3:04 PM UTCShare this story Illustration by Nick Barclay / The VergeMeta has acknowledged that all text and photos that adult Facebook and Instagram users have publicly published since 2007 have been fed into its artificial intelligence models. Australia\u2019s ABC News reports that Meta\u2019s global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, initially rejected claims about user data from 2007 being leveraged for AI training during a local government inquiry about AI adoption before relenting after additional questioning.\u201cThe truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007 unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private,\u201d Green Party senator David Shoebridge pushed in the inquiry. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cCorrect,\u201d Claybaugh responded.Meta\u2019s privacy center and blog posts acknowledge hoovering up public posts and comments from Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI:We use public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI models for these features and for the open source community.We don\u2019t use posts or comments with an audience other than Public for these purposes.But the company has been vague about how data is used, when it started scraping, and how far back its collection goes. Asked by The New York Times in June, Meta didn\u2019t answer, other than to confirm that setting posts to anything besides \u201cpublic\u201d will prevent future scraping. That still won\u2019t delete data that has already been collected \u2014 and people posting back in 2007 (who may have been minors at the time) wouldn\u2019t have known their photos and posts would be used in this way.RelatedMeta\u2019s future is AI, AI, and more AIHow to keep your images out of AI generatorsClaybaugh said that Meta doesn\u2019t scrape data from users who are under the age of 18. When Labor Party senator Tony Sheldon asked if Meta would scrape the public photos of his children on his own account, Claybaugh confirmed it would and was unable to clarify if the company also scraped adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child.European users can opt out due to local privacy regulations, and Meta was recently banned from using Brazilian personal data for AI training, but the billions of Facebook and Instagram users in other regions can\u2019t opt out if they want to keep their posts public. Claybaugh was unable to say if Australian users (or anyone else) would be given a choice to opt out in the future, arguing that the option was given to European users because of uncertainty regarding its regulatory landscape.\u201cMeta made it clear today that if Australia had these same laws Australians\u2019 data would also have been protected,\u201d Shoebridge said to ABC News. \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to act on privacy means companies like Meta are continuing to monetize and exploit pictures and videos of children on Facebook.\u201dCommentsMost PopularMost PopularThe great Evernote rebootThe best Android phone to buy in 2023Apple will charge more to swap your iPhone 16 Pro batteryThe fanciest game console you can buyShogun Showdown makes you feel like a genius by showing you the futureVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

In contrast, Amazon boasts more than 9,000 patents; half of which were filed during the same timeframe, underpinning its leadership in AI-driven retail innovations.\\nAI-powered retail transformation\\nWalmart is deploying AI-driven solutions like in-store product recognition while making notable strides in AR applications, including virtual try-ons. The company\u2019s progress in smart warehouses and image-based transactions denotes a shift towards fully automated retail, enhancing both speed and precision in customer service.\\nAmazon stands out with its extensive deployment of AI in customer personalisation and autonomous systems. By harnessing technologies such as Autonomous Network Virtualisation and Automated VNF Deployment, the company is advancing its operational infrastructure and aiming to set new standards in network efficiency and data management.\\nWalmart\u2019s development of intelligent voice assistants and automated store surveillance emphasises its aim to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience. Concurrently, Amazon\u2019s progress in AI for coding and surveillance is pushing the boundaries of enterprise AI applications and enhancing security capabilities.\\n\u201cAs these two giants continue to push the boundaries of retail AI, the broader industry can expect ripple effects in supply chain innovation, customer loyalty programmes, and operational scalability\u2014setting the stage for a new era of consumer engagement.\u201d\\n(Photo by Marques Thomas)\\nSee also: Whitepaper dispels fears of AI-induced job losses\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nA singer from the United States has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently inflate his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties.\nMichael Smith, 52, from North Carolina, faces charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.\nAccording to the BBC, authorities allege that this is the first time AI has been used to allow such a large-scale streaming scam. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasised the scope of the fraud, claiming that Smith took millions of dollars in royalties that should have gone to real musicians, songwriters and rights holders.\nThe accusations stem from an unsealed indictment alleging that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms. To avoid detection, automated bots streamed the tracks\u2014sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.\nThe FBI played a crucial role in the investigation. The agency\u2019s acting assistant director, Christie M. Curtis, explained that the agency was dedicated to tracking down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings while simultaneously undermining the efforts of real artists.\nAccording to the indictment, Smith began working with the CEO of an undisclosed AI music firm around 2018. This co-conspirator allegedly provided Smith with thousands of AI-generated tracks each month. In exchange, Smith offered metadata such as song titles and artist names, and offered a share of streaming earnings.\nOne email exchange between Smith and the unnamed CEO in March 2019 demonstrates how the plot took shape. The executive stated, \u201cKeep in mind what we\u2019re doing musically here\u2026this is not \u2018music,\u2019 [but] \u2018instant music\u2019).\u201d The email emphasises the operation\u2019s intentional nature, as well as the use of AI to generate large amounts of content with minimal effort. According to the indictment, the technology improved over time, making it harder for streaming platforms to detect fraudulent streams.\nIn another email dated February, Smith boasted that his AI-generated tracks had accumulated over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019. If convicted, Smith faces significant prison time for the charges brought against him.\nThe Smith case is not the only one involving bogus music streaming royalties. Earlier this year, a Danish man received an 18-month term for a similar plan. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube forbid bots and artificial streams from being used to boost royalties. Such behaviour is disruptive and illegal, and platforms have taken steps to combat it through policy changes. For instance, if artificial streams are detected, Spotify charges the label or distributor and music can earn royalties only if it meets certain criteria.\nNevertheless, the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry. Musicians and record companies fear they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text and images. Such tools reportedly sometimes use content that musicians and other creators have posted on the internet, raising questions about copyright infringement.\nTension came to a head in 2023 when a track that mimicked the voices of popular artists Drake and The Weeknd went viral, prompting streaming platforms to remove it. Earlier this year, several high-profile musicians, including Billie Eilish, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith, signed an open letter urging the music industry to address the \u201cpredatory\u201d use of AI to generate content.\n(Photo by israel palacio)\nSee also: Whitepaper dispels fears of AI-induced job losses\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nA singer from the United States has been accused of manipulating music streaming platforms using AI technologies and bots to fraudulently inflate his stream statistics and earn millions of dollars in royalties.\nMichael Smith, 52, from North Carolina, faces charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.\nAccording to the BBC, authorities allege that this is the first time AI has been used to allow such a large-scale streaming scam. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasised the scope of the fraud, claiming that Smith took millions of dollars in royalties that should have gone to real musicians, songwriters and rights holders.\nThe accusations stem from an unsealed indictment alleging that Smith distributed hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs across multiple streaming platforms. To avoid detection, automated bots streamed the tracks\u2014sometimes up to 10,000 at a time. Smith allegedly earned more than $10 million in illegal royalties over several years.\nThe FBI played a crucial role in the investigation. The agency\u2019s acting assistant director, Christie M. Curtis, explained that the agency was dedicated to tracking down those who misuse technology to rob people of their earnings while simultaneously undermining the efforts of real artists.\nAccording to the indictment, Smith began working with the CEO of an undisclosed AI music firm around 2018. This co-conspirator allegedly provided Smith with thousands of AI-generated tracks each month. In exchange, Smith offered metadata such as song titles and artist names, and offered a share of streaming earnings.\nOne email exchange between Smith and the unnamed CEO in March 2019 demonstrates how the plot took shape. The executive stated, \u201cKeep in mind what we\u2019re doing musically here\u2026this is not \u2018music,\u2019 [but] \u2018instant music\u2019).\u201d The email emphasises the operation\u2019s intentional nature, as well as the use of AI to generate large amounts of content with minimal effort. According to the indictment, the technology improved over time, making it harder for streaming platforms to detect fraudulent streams.\nIn another email dated February, Smith boasted that his AI-generated tracks had accumulated over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019. If convicted, Smith faces significant prison time for the charges brought against him.\nThe Smith case is not the only one involving bogus music streaming royalties. Earlier this year, a Danish man received an 18-month term for a similar plan. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube forbid bots and artificial streams from being used to boost royalties. Such behaviour is disruptive and illegal, and platforms have taken steps to combat it through policy changes. For instance, if artificial streams are detected, Spotify charges the label or distributor and music can earn royalties only if it meets certain criteria.\nNevertheless, the proliferation of AI-generated music continues to disrupt the music industry. Musicians and record companies fear they will lose revenue and recognition due to AI tools capable of creating music, text and images. Such tools reportedly sometimes use content that musicians and other creators have posted on the internet, raising questions about copyright infringement.\nTension came to a head in 2023 when a track that mimicked the voices of popular artists Drake and The Weeknd went viral, prompting streaming platforms to remove it. Earlier this year, several high-profile musicians, including Billie Eilish, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith, signed an open letter urging the music industry to address the \u201cpredatory\u201d use of AI to generate content.\n(Photo by israel palacio)\nSee also: Whitepaper dispels fears of AI-induced job losses\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nA new survey from SolarWinds has unveiled a resounding call for increased government oversight of AI, with 88% of IT professionals advocating for stronger regulation.\nThe study, which polled nearly 700 IT experts, highlights security as the paramount concern. An overwhelming 72% of respondents emphasised the critical need for measures to secure infrastructure. Privacy follows closely behind, with 64% of IT professionals urging for more robust rules to protect sensitive information.\nRob Johnson, VP and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at SolarWinds, commented: \u201cIt is understandable that IT leaders are approaching AI with caution. As technology rapidly evolves, it naturally presents challenges typical of any emerging innovation.\n\u201cSecurity and privacy remain at the forefront, with ongoing scrutiny by regulatory bodies. However, it is incumbent upon organisations to take proactive measures by enhancing data hygiene, enforcing robust AI ethics and assembling the right teams to lead these efforts. This proactive stance not only helps with compliance with evolving regulations but also maximises the potential of AI.\u201d\nThe survey\u2019s findings come at a pivotal moment, coinciding with the implementation of the EU\u2019s AI Act. In the UK, the new Labour government recently proposed its own AI legislation during the latest King\u2019s speech, signalling a growing recognition of the need for regulatory frameworks. In the US, the California State Assembly passed a controversial AI safety bill last month.\nBeyond security and privacy, the survey reveals a broader spectrum of concerns amongst IT professionals. A majority (55%) believe government intervention is crucial to stem the tide of AI-generated misinformation. Additionally, half of the respondents support regulations aimed at ensuring transparency and ethical practices in AI development.\nChallenges extend beyond AI regulation\nHowever, the challenges facing AI adoption extend beyond regulatory concerns. The survey uncovers a troubling lack of trust in data quality\u2014a cornerstone of successful AI implementation.\nOnly 38% of respondents consider themselves \u2018very trusting\u2019 of the data quality and training used in AI systems. This scepticism is not unfounded, as 40% of IT leaders who have encountered issues with AI attribute these problems to algorithmic errors stemming from insufficient or biased data.\nConsequently, data quality emerges as the second most significant barrier to AI adoption (16%), trailing only behind security and privacy risks. This finding underscores the critical importance of robust, unbiased datasets in driving AI success.\n\u201cHigh-quality data is the cornerstone of accurate and reliable AI models, which in turn drive better decision-making and outcomes,\u201d adds Johnson. \u201cTrustworthy data builds confidence in AI among IT professionals, accelerating the broader adoption and integration of AI technologies.\u201d\nThe survey also sheds light on widespread concerns about database readiness. Less than half (43%) of IT professionals express confidence in their company\u2019s ability to meet the increasing data demands of AI. This lack of preparedness is further exacerbated by the perception that organisations are not moving swiftly enough to implement AI, with 46% of respondents citing ongoing data quality challenges as a contributing factor.\nAs AI continues to reshape the technological landscape, the findings of this SolarWinds survey serve as a clarion call for both stronger regulation and improved data practices. The message from IT professionals is clear: while AI holds immense promise, its successful integration hinges on addressing critical concerns around security, privacy, and data quality.\n(Photo by Kelly Sikkema)\nSee also: Whitepaper dispels fears of AI-induced job losses\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The announcement was made during the company\u2019s annual Apsara Conference.\nThe cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group has also unveiled a revamped full-stack infrastructure designed to meet the surging demand for robust AI computing. This new infrastructure encompasses innovative cloud products and services that enhance computing, networking, and data centre architecture, all aimed at supporting the development and wide-ranging applications of AI models.\nEddie Wu, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, said: \u201cAlibaba Cloud is investing, with unprecedented intensity, in the research and development of AI technology and the building of its global infrastructure. We aim to establish an AI infrastructure of the future to serve our global customers and unlock their business potential.\u201d\nThe newly-released Qwen 2.5 models range from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters in size and boast enhanced knowledge and stronger capabilities in maths and coding. Supporting over 29 languages, these models cater to a wide array of AI applications both at the edge and in the cloud across various sectors, from automotive and gaming to scientific research.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s open-source AI models gain traction\nSince its debut in April 2023, the Qwen model series has garnered significant traction, surpassing 40 million downloads across platforms such as Hugging Face and ModelScope. These models have also inspired the creation of over 50,000 derivative models on Hugging Face alone.\nJingren Zhou, CTO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, commented: \u201cThis initiative is set to empower developers and corporations of all sizes, enhancing their ability to leverage AI technologies and further stimulating the growth of the open-source community.\u201d\nIn addition to the open-source models, Alibaba Cloud announced an upgrade to its proprietary flagship model, Qwen-Max. The enhanced version reportedly demonstrates performance on par with other state-of-the-art models in areas such as language comprehension, reasoning, mathematics, and coding.\nThe company has also expanded its multimodal capabilities with a new text-to-video model as part of its Tongyi Wanxiang large model family. This model can generate high-quality videos in various visual styles, from realistic scenes to 3D animation, based on Chinese and English text instructions.\nFurthermore, Alibaba Cloud introduced Qwen2-VL, an updated vision language model capable of comprehending videos lasting over 20 minutes and supporting video-based question-answering. The company also launched an AI Developer, a Qwen-powered AI assistant designed to support programmers in automating tasks such as requirement analysis, code programming, and bug identification and fixing.\nTo support these AI advancements, Alibaba Cloud has announced several infrastructure upgrades, including:\nCUBE DC 5.0, a next-generation data centre architecture that increases energy and operational efficiency.\nAlibaba Cloud Open Lake, a solution to maximise data utility for generative AI applications.\nPAI AI Scheduler, a proprietary cloud-native scheduling engine for enhanced computing resource management.\nDMS: OneMeta+OneOps, a platform for unified management of metadata across multiple cloud environments.\n9th Generation Enterprise Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance, offering improved performance for various applications.\nThese updates from Alibaba Cloud \u2013 including the release of over 100 open-source models \u2013 aim to provide comprehensive support for customers and partners to maximise the benefits of the latest technology in building more efficient, sustainable, and inclusive AI applications.\n(Image Source: www.alibabagroup.com)\nSee also: Tech industry giants urge EU to streamline AI regulations\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nMeta has spearheaded an open letter calling for urgent reform of AI regulations in the EU. The letter, which garnered support from over 50 prominent companies \u2013 including Ericsson, SAP, and Spotify \u2013 was published as an advert in the Financial Times.\nThe collective voice of these industry leaders highlights a pressing issue: Europe\u2019s bureaucratic approach to AI regulation may be stifling innovation and causing the region to lag behind its global counterparts.\n\u201cEurope has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions and it now risks falling further behind in the AI era due to inconsistent regulatory decision making,\u201d the letter states, painting a stark picture of the continent\u2019s current position in the AI race.\nThe signatories emphasise two key areas of concern. Firstly, they point to the development of \u2018open\u2019 models, which are freely available for use, modification, and further development. These models are lauded for their potential to \u201cmultiply the benefits and spread social and economic opportunity\u201d while simultaneously bolstering sovereignty and control.\nSecondly, the letter underscores the importance of \u2018multimodal\u2019 models, which integrate text, images, and speech capabilities. The signatories argue that the leap from text-only to multimodal models is akin to \u201cthe difference between having only one sense and having all five of them\u201d. They assert that these advanced models could significantly boost productivity, drive scientific research, and inject hundreds of billions of euros into the European economy.\nHowever, the crux of the matter lies in the regulatory landscape. The letter expresses frustration with the uncertainty surrounding data usage for AI model training, stemming from interventions by European Data Protection Authorities. This ambiguity, they argue, could result in Large Language Models (LLMs) lacking crucial Europe-specific training data.\nTo address these challenges, the signatories call for \u201charmonised, consistent, quick and clear decisions under EU data regulations that enable European data to be used in AI training for the benefit of Europeans\u201d. They stress the need for \u201cdecisive action\u201d to unlock Europe\u2019s potential for creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, which they believe is essential for the region\u2019s prosperity and technological leadership.\nA copy of the letter can be found below:\nWhile the letter acknowledges the importance of consumer protection, it also highlights the delicate balance regulators must strike to avoid hindering commercial progress. The European Commission\u2019s approach to regulation has often been criticised for its perceived heavy-handedness, and this latest appeal from industry leaders adds weight to growing concerns about the region\u2019s global competitiveness in the AI sector.\nThe pressure is rapidly mounting on European policymakers to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while maintaining appropriate safeguards. The coming months will likely see intensified dialogue between industry stakeholders and regulators as they grapple with these complex issues that will shape the future of AI development in Europe.\n(Photo by Sara Kurfe\u00df)\nSee also: SolarWinds: IT professionals want stronger AI regulation\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

What the\u00a0Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship\u00a0just launched has a bit more horsepower.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not a Ferrari yet, but we have a car,\u201d says Bill Aulet,\u00a0the center\u2019s managing director. The vehicle: the MIT Entrepreneurship JetPack, a generative artificial intelligence tool trained on Aulet\u2019s 24-step\u00a0Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework to input prompts into large language models.Introduce a startup idea to the Eship JetPack, \u201cand it\u2019s like having five or 10 or 12 MIT undergraduates who instantaneously run out and do all the research you want based on the question you asked, and then they bring back the answer,\u201d Aulet says.The tool is currently being used by entrepreneurship students and piloted outside MIT, and there is a\u00a0waitlist\u00a0that prospective users can join. The tool is accessed through the Trust Center\u2019s\u00a0Orbit\u00a0digital entrepreneurship platform, which was launched for student use in 2019. Orbit grew out of a need for an alternative to the static Trust Center website, Aulet says.\u201cWe weren\u2019t following our own protocols of entrepreneurship,\u201d he says. \u201cYou meet the students where they are, and more and more of them were on their phones. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s build an app that\u2019s more dynamic than a static website, and that will be the way that we can get to the students.\u201dWith the help of Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek and Product Lead\u00a0Doug Williams, Orbit has become a one-stop shop for student entrepreneurs. On the platform\u2019s back end, leaders at the center are able to see what users are and are not clicking on.Aulet and his team have been studying that user information since Orbit\u2019s launch. It\u2019s enabled them to learn how students want to access information, not just about course offerings or startup competition applications but also to get guidance on an idea they\u2019re working on or connect to an entrepreneurial community of co-founders and advisers. The team also received advice from\u00a0Ethan Mollick SM \u201904, PhD \u201910, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School and author of a new book, \u201cCo-Intelligence: Living and Working With AI.\u201dOfficial work on the Eship JetPack began about six months ago. The name was inspired by\u00a0the acceleration a jet pack provides, and the need for a human to take advantage of the boost and guide its direction.\u201cAs we moved from our initial focus on capturing information to providing guidance, MIT's Disciplined Entrepreneurship and\u00a0Startup Tactics frameworks\u00a0were the perfect place to start,\u201d Williams says.One of the earliest beta users,\u00a0Shari Van Cleave, MBA \u201915, demonstrated how to use the AI tool in a\u00a0YouTube video.She submitted an experimental idea for mobile electric vehicle charging, and within seconds the AI tool suggested market segments,\u00a0beachhead markets, a business model, pricing, assumptions, testing, and a product plan \u2014 and that\u2019s only seven of the 24 steps of the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework that\u00a0she explored.\u201cI was impressed by how quickly the AI, with just a few details, generated recommendations for everything from market-sizing (TAM) to lifetime customer value models,\u201d Van Cleave said in an email. \u201cHaving a high-quality rough draft means founders, whether new or experienced, can execute and fundraise faster.\u201dAnd for those entrepreneurs who might already have an idea and be well on their way through the 24-step process, the tool can be useful for them, too, Aulet says. For example, they might want insights and quotes about how their company can improve its performance or determine whether there\u2019s a better market to be targeting.\u201cOur goal is to lift the field of entrepreneurship, and a tool like this would allow more people to be entrepreneurs, and be better entrepreneurs,\u201d Aulet says.\nShare this news article on:\nX\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPrint\nRelated Links\nBill AuletMartin Trust Center for MIT EntrepreneurshipMIT Sloan School of Management\nRelated Topics\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E)\nBusiness and management\nMIT Sloan School of Management\nMartin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship\nArtificial intelligence\nStartups\nStudents\nRelated Articles\nCelebrating student entrepreneurship at delta v\u2019s 2024 Demo Day \nMIT Faculty Founder Initiative announces three winners of entrepreneurship awards \n3 Questions: Paul Cheek on tactics for new startups \nPrevious item\nNext item\nMore MIT News\nA two-dose schedule could make HIV vaccines more effective\n MIT researchers find that the first dose primes the immune system, helping it to generate a strong response to the second dose, a week later.\nRead full story \u2192\nEngineers 3D print sturdy glass bricks for building structures\n The interlocking bricks, which can be repurposed many times over, can withstand similar pressures as their concrete counterparts.\nRead full story \u2192\nMIT course helps researchers crack secrets of ancient pottery\n A summer class teaches PhD students and early-career archaeologists ceramic petrography, revealing the origins and production methods of past societies.\nRead full story \u2192\nAI model can reveal the structures of crystalline materials\n By analyzing X-ray crystallography data, the model could help researchers develop new materials for many applications, including batteries and magnets.\nRead full story \u2192\nStudy: AI could lead to inconsistent outcomes in home surveillance\n Researchers find large language models make inconsistent decisions about whether to call the police when analyzing surveillance videos.\nRead full story \u2192\n Improving biology education here, there, and everywhere\n At the cutting edge of pedagogy, Mary Ellen Wiltrout has shaped blended and online learning at MIT and beyond.\nRead full story \u2192\nMore news on MIT News homepage \u2192\nMore about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office of Communications.\nNews by Schools/College:\nSchool of Architecture and Planning\nSchool of Engineering\nSchool of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\nMIT Sloan School of Management\nSchool of Science\nMIT Schwarzman College of Computing\nResources:\nAbout the MIT News Office\nMIT News Press Center\nTerms of Use\nPress Inquiries\nFilming Guidelines\nRSS Feeds\nTools:\nSubscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\nSubscribe to press releases\nSubmit campus news\nGuidelines for campus news contributors\nGuidelines on generative AI\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nMIT Top Level Links:\nEducation\nResearch\nInnovation\nAdmissions + Aid\nCampus Life\nNews\nAlumni\nAbout MIT\n Join us in building a better world.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, USA\nRecommended Links:\nVisit\nMap (opens in new window)\nEvents (opens in new window)\nPeople (opens in new window)\nCareers (opens in new window)\nContact\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSocial Media Hub\nMIT on X\nMIT on Facebook\nMIT on YouTube\nMIT on Instagram"}

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nBeam has deployed the world\u2019s first AI-driven autonomous underwater vehicle for offshore wind farm inspections. The technology has already proved its mettle by inspecting jacket structures at Scotland\u2019s largest offshore wind farm, Seagreen\u2014a joint venture between SSE Renewables, TotalEnergies, and PTTEP.\nThe AI-powered vehicle represents a significant leap forward in marine technology and underwater robotics. Capable of conducting complex underwater inspections without human intervention, it promises to dramatically enhance efficiency and slash costs associated with underwater surveys and inspections.\nTraditionally, offshore wind site inspections have been manual, labour-intensive processes. Beam\u2019s autonomous solution offers a radical departure from this approach, enabling data to be streamed directly back to shore. This shift allows offshore workers to concentrate on more intricate tasks while reducing inspection timelines by up to 50%, resulting in substantial operational cost savings.\nBrian Allen, CEO of Beam, said: \u201cWe are very proud to have succeeded in deploying the world\u2019s first autonomous underwater vehicle driven by AI. Automation can revolutionise how we carry out inspection and maintenance of offshore wind farms, helping to reduce both costs and timelines.\u201d\nBeyond improved efficiency, Beam\u2019s technology elevates the quality of inspection data and facilitates the creation of 3D reconstructions of assets alongside visual data. This deployment marks a crucial step in Beam\u2019s roadmap for autonomous technology, with plans to extend this AI-driven solution across its fleet of DP2 vessels, ROVs, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) throughout 2025 and 2026.\n\u201cLooking ahead to the future, the potential of this technology is huge for the industry, and success in these initial projects is vital for us to progress and realise this vision. This wouldn\u2019t be possible without forward-thinking customers like SSE Renewables who are willing to go on the journey with us,\u201d explained Allen.\nThe Seagreen wind farm, operational since October 2023, is the world\u2019s deepest fixed-bottom offshore wind farm. Beam\u2019s project at Seagreen has provided crucial insights into the potential of autonomous technology for large offshore wind superstructures. The data collected by the AI-driven vehicle will support ongoing operational reliability at the site, offering valuable information on areas such as marine growth and potential erosion at the foundations.\nMatthew Henderson, Technical Asset Manager \u2013 Substructure and Asset Lifecycle at SSE Renewables, commented: \u201cAt SSE, we have a mantra that \u2018if it\u2019s not safe, we don\u2019t do it.\u2019 Beam\u2019s technology demonstrates that autonomous inspections can reduce the personnel we need to send offshore for planned inspections, while speeding up planned works and collecting rich data-sets to inform asset integrity planning.\n\u201cAs we move further offshore, and into deeper waters, the ability to collect high-quality inspection data in a low-risk manner is imperative to us delivering our Net Zero Acceleration Programme.\u201d\nAs Beam prepares to roll out its AI-driven inspection technology across its fleet in 2025 and 2026, this deployment aligns with the company\u2019s mission to revolutionise offshore wind operations by making them more efficient and cost-effective\u2014further supporting the global energy transition.\nThe success of this AI-powered underwater vehicle at Seagreen wind farm not only demonstrates the potential of autonomous technology in offshore wind inspections but also sets a new standard for safety, efficiency, and data quality in the industry. Such innovations will play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of offshore wind energy.\nSee also: Hugging Face is launching an open robotics project\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

She has more than eight years of experience writing about ecommerce, technology, entrepreneurship, and all things SaaS. Hazel loves to split her time between writing, editing and hanging out with her family.\n\nStaying competitive in modern sales today effectively means embracing the latest trends in tech.\nSince late 2022 \u2013 when generative AI made its way to the public\u2019s consciousness thanks to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2013 AI has been at the forefront of this shift, changing the way sales teams (like most other teams) operate and connect with clients.\nIn this blog post, let\u2019s dive into how AI is streamlining sales activities and helping boost conversion rates.\nHere are the top five ways sales teams can use AI to better personalise interactions, automate admin work, and more, proving that it\u2019s not just about cutting costs but transforming how sales are done.\n\n1. Personalised engagement\nA typical sales cycle is complex, involving multiple touchpoints and interactions before conversion. Deeper personalisation involves understanding a prospect\u2019s business needs, challenges, and industry trends. AI tools are particularly adept at sifting through large datasets to uncover insights that tailor interactions to these specific business contexts.\nFor instance, AI can analyse past interactions, like email exchanges and engagement history, to determine what type of content or product features are most relevant to a specific client. This allows sales teams to offer solutions that are not just generic services or products but are customised to address the client\u2019s unique challenges and goals.\nAI can enhance account-based marketing (ABM) strategies by enabling sales teams to create highly personalised content strategies for each account. By analysing data from various touchpoints in the quote to cash process, AI helps in crafting messages that resonate deeply with each decision-maker in the client\u2019s organisation. This targeted approach not only strengthens relationships but also significantly increases the likelihood of closing deals.\n\n2. Sales forecasting\nAccurate sales forecasting is vital in B2B sales, where strategic planning and resource allocation depend heavily on predicted sales outcomes. AI significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of these forecasts by analysing vast amounts of data and identifying trends that are hard to spot.\nAI-driven pipeline forecasting tools use historical sales data, market conditions, and real-time sales activity to predict future sales performance. These tools employ predictive analytics to model various scenarios and their potential impacts on sales, helping sales teams to prepare more effectively for future market movements.\nMoreover, AI-enhanced forecasting tools can dynamically update predictions based on new data. This means that sales forecasts are not static but evolve as more interaction and transaction data becomes available. Such dynamic forecasting ensures that sales strategies remain agile and responsive to changes, increasing the overall efficiency of sales operations.\n\nBy leveraging AI for advanced sales forecasting, B2B companies can not only forecast with greater accuracy but also gain strategic insights that can lead to a more proactive approach in managing sales pipelines and customer relationships.\n\n3. Dynamic pricing\nDynamic pricing is an advanced AI application that can significantly boost B2B sales performance by optimising pricing strategies based on real-time market data and customer behaviour. This technology allows companies to adjust their pricing models swiftly in response to changes in the market or customer demand, ensuring competitiveness and maximising revenue.\nAI tools like Competera analyse historical sales data, market dynamics, competitor pricing, and customer patterns to recommend the most effective pricing strategies for various products and services. For instance, it can suggest special discounts for high-value clients or adjust prices during peak demand periods to capitalise on market trends.\nAI-driven dynamic pricing can enhance customer satisfaction by offering fair prices that reflect the current value of the products or services, which can differ across customer segments or even individual clients based on their purchase history and loyalty.\n\nBy integrating dynamic pricing models powered by AI, sales teams not only streamline their pricing strategies but also ensure that they are adaptable, data-driven, and closely aligned with both market conditions and customer expectations.\n\nFor B2B companies aiming to refine their pricing and sales strategies, an AI consulting service is a crucial edge. By engaging advanced data analytics and AI/ML expertise, these services enhance data-driven decision-making, improve customer relationships, and accelerate sales cycles, fostering a more competitive and efficient sales process.\n\n4. Lead scoring and prioritisation\nWhen you have a healthy influx of leads, efficiently managing them is crucial. Sales teams can use AI to dramatically enhance this process through sophisticated lead scoring systems, which assess and rank prospects based on their likelihood to convert. This prioritisation ensures that sales teams focus their efforts on the most promising leads, optimising both time and resources.\n\nAI tools integrate various data points like past interactions, engagement levels, company size, and industry-specific behaviours to create a comprehensive profile of each lead. AI algorithms can examine historical data to recognise patterns that indicate a high probability of conversion. This might include the frequency of communications, the types of questions asked by the prospect, or their engagement with specific content.\nFor example, Salesforce Einstein uses machine learning to continuously refine its scoring model based on new data, making the lead qualification process more dynamic and accurate. By automating the identification of high-potential leads, sales teams can allocate more time to crafting personalised outreach strategies that are more likely to resonate with top-tier prospects.\n\nMoreover, AI-powered lead scoring can alert sales teams to changes in a lead\u2019s score in real-time. This means that if a prospect\u2019s engagement level increases due to a recent interaction or a change in their business needs, the sales team can immediately capitalise on this opportunity, increasing the chances of a successful sale.\n\nSo, by leveraging AI for lead scoring and prioritisation, sales teams can ensure they are not just reaching out to more leads, but are reaching out to the right leads at the right time.\n\n5. Automating administrative tasks\nAI\u2019s prowess to automate administrative tasks is a game changer in B2B sales, where efficiency and time management are critical. By taking over routine tasks, AI allows sales teams to dedicate more energy and focus to engaging with clients and closing deals.\n\nFor instance, AI-powered CRM tools can handle data entry, manage email sequences, schedule meetings, and update logs with new client information. This automation streamlines the sales process, reducing the administrative burden and minimising the potential for human error.\n\nAI-driven automation extends to crafting and sending follow-up emails. AI can analyse the interaction history with each client to determine the most effective follow-up strategy, tailoring messages based on the client\u2019s previous responses and engagement level. This personalised approach ensures that communications are relevant and timely, thereby increasing the likelihood of maintaining the client\u2019s interest and pushing the sales process forward.\n\nAnd, AI can offer predictive insights about the best times to contact clients or send out proposals, based on data patterns that include client availability and response rates. This predictive capability ensures that sales efforts are not just systematic but also strategically timed, maximising the impact of each interaction.\n\nBy leveraging AI to automate these essential but repetitive tasks, B2B sales teams can significantly improve their productivity and effectiveness, allowing them to focus on what they do best \u2013 building relationships and closing sales.\n\nWrapping up\nThe integration of AI tools in modern sales processes brings efficiency and effectiveness, allowing sales teams to focus on strategic aspects of sales like relationship building and closing high-value deals. Teams that embrace AI can expect not only increased conversion rates but also more responsive sales ops that can adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.\n\nAll in all, companies that welcome ongoing adaptation and investment in AI tools will be well-positioned to lead in their industries, leveraging AI not just as a tool, but as a core component of their sales strategy.\"\n\nNote: The provided answer is the complete content of the webpage at the given URL."}

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nAs AI applications evolve, they place greater demands on network infrastructure, particularly in terms of latency and connectivity.\nSupporting large-scale AI deployments introduces new issues, and analysts predict that AI-related traffic will soon account for a major portion of total network traffic. The industry must be prepared to handle this surge effectively. F5 is adapting its solutions to manage the complexity of AI workloads, and its technology now includes real-time processing of multimodal data.\nKunal Anand, Chief Technology and AI Officer at F5 (Source \u2013 F5)\nAI presents both opportunities and risks in security, as it has the capability to enhance protection while also enabling AI-driven cyber threats. Collaboration among hyperscalers, telcos, and technology companies is critical for establishing AI-optimised networks. Collaboration and innovation continue to change the AI networking landscape, and F5 is dedicated to driving progress in this area.\nAhead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Kunal Anand, Chief Technology and AI Officer at F5, discusses the company\u2019s role and initiatives to stay at the forefront of AI-enabled networking solutions.\nAI News: As AI applications evolve, the demands on network infrastructure are becoming more complex. What key challenges does the industry face regarding latency and connectivity in supporting large-scale AI deployments?\n\nAnand: F5 discovered that AI has drastically transformed application architectures. Some companies are investing billions of dollars in AI factories \u2013 massive GPU clusters \u2013 while others prefer cloud-based solutions or small language models (SLMs) as less expensive alternatives.\n\nNetwork architectures are evolving to address these challenges. AI factories operate on distinct networking stacks, like InfiniBand with specific GPUs like the H100s or NVIDIA\u2019s upcoming Blackwell series. At the same time, cloud-based technologies and GPU clouds are advancing.\n\nA major trend is data gravity, where organisations\u2019 data is locked in specific environments. This has driven the evolution of multi-cloud architectures, allowing workloads to link with data across environments for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\nAs RAG demands rise, organisations face higher latency because of limited resources, whether from heavily used data stores or limited sets of GPU servers.\n\nAI News: As analysts predict AI-related traffic will soon make up a significant portion of network traffic. What unique challenges does this influx of AI-generated traffic pose for existing network infrastructure, and how do you see the industry preparing for it?\n\nAnand: F5 believes that by the end of the decade, most applications will be AI-powered or AI-driven, necessitating augmentation across the network services chain. These applications will use APIs to communicate with AI factories and third-party services, access data for RAG, and potentially expose their own APIs. Essentially, APIs will be the glue holding this ecosystem together, as analysts have suggested.\n\nLooking ahead, AI-related traffic is expected to dominate network traffic as AI becomes increasingly integrated into applications and APIs. As AI becomes central to practically all applications, AI-related traffic will naturally increase.\n\nAI News: With AI applications becoming more complex and processing multimodal data in real time, how is F5 adapting its solutions to ensure networks can efficiently manage these dynamic workloads?\n\nAnand: F5 looks at this from many angles. In the case of RAG, when data \u2013 whether images, binary streams, or text \u2013 must be retrieved from a data storage, the method is the same regardless of data format. Customers often want quick Layer 4 load balancing, traffic management, and steering capabilities, all of which F5 excels at. The company provides organisations with load balancing, traffic management, and security services, guaranteeing RAG has efficient data access. F5 has also enabled load balancing among AI factories.\n\nIn some cases, large organisations manage massive GPU clusters with tens of thousands of GPUs. Since AI workloads are unpredictable, these GPUs may be available or unavailable depending on the workload. F5 ensures efficient traffic routing, mitigating the unpredictability of AI workloads.\n\nF5 improves performance, increases throughput, and adds security capabilities for organisations building AI factories and clusters.\n\nAI News: As AI enhances security while also posing AI-driven cyber threats, what approaches is F5 taking to strengthen network security and resilience against these evolving challenges?\n\nAnand: There are many different AI-related challenges on the way. Attackers are already employing AI to generate new payloads, find loopholes, and launch unique attacks. For example, ChatGPT and visual transformers have the ability to break CAPTCHAs, especially interactive ones. Recent demonstrations have shown the sophistication of these attacks.\n\nAs seen in past security patterns, every time attackers gain an advantage with new technology, defenders must rise to the challenge. This often necessitates reconsidering security models, like shifting from \u201callow everything, deny some\u201d to \u201callow some, deny everything.\u201d Many organisations are exploring solutions to combat AI-driven threats.\n\nF5 is making big investments to keep ahead of AI-driven threats. As part of its F5 intelligence programme, the company is developing, training, and deploying models, which are supported by its AI Center of Excellence.\n\nEarlier this year, F5 launched an AI data fabric, with a team dedicated to developing models that serve the entire business, from policy creation to insight delivery. F5 feels it is well placed to face these rising issues.\n\nAI News: What role do partnerships play in developing the next generation of AI-optimised networks, especially between hyperscalers, telcos, and tech companies?\n\nAnand: Partnerships are important for AI development. The AI stack is complex and involves several components, including electricity, data centres, hardware, servers, GPUs, memory, computational power, and a networking stack, all of which must function together. It is unusual for a single organisation to oversee everything from start to finish.\n\nF5 focuses on establishing and maintaining the necessary partnerships in computation, networking, and storage to support AI.\n\nAI News: How does F5 view its role in advancing AI networking, and what initiatives are you focusing on to stay at the forefront of AI-enabled networking solutions?\n\nAnand: F5 is committed to developing its technology platform. The AI Data Fabric, launched earlier this year, will work with the AI Center of Excellence to prepare the organisation for the future.\n\nF5 is also forming strong partnerships, with announcements to come. The company is excited about its work and the rapid pace of global change. F5\u2019s unique vantage point \u2013 processing worldwide traffic \u2013 enables it to correlate data insights with industry trends. F5 also intends to be more forthcoming about its research and models, with some open-source contributions coming soon.\n\nOverall, F5 is incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative impact of AI is remarkable, and it is an exciting time to be part of this shift.\n(Image by Lucent_Designs_dinoson20)\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

However, as healthcare providers have to deal with excessive amounts of data, managing it can feel overwhelming. With the advent of intelligent document processing technology, a new solution can now be implemented. This article explores how such technology works, its role in healthcare documentation, and its benefits, limitations, and implications for the future.\nIntelligent document processing and its importance\nIntelligent document processing is a more advanced type of automation based on AI technology, machine learning, natural language processing, and optical character recognition to collect, process, and organise data from multiple forms of paperwork. Unlike traditional document systems, IDP can handle unstructured and semi-structured data for multiple healthcare documents, which can exist in various forms. As such data is based on advanced, permanent algorithms and artificial intelligence tools, IDP can enhance the functions of healthcare providers and assist them in the care delivery process.\nIDP\u2019s role in healthcare documentation\nMultiple forms of documents, like health, employment, or insurance records, reports, notes, forms, and social documents, have to be dealt with by multiple providers daily. IDP can reduce the need for inefficient data management processes through:\nAutomating the data extraction process by automatically capturing the essential information from the documents. Thus, it reduces the human factor and enhance performance,\nEstablishing more accurate data With AI algorithms. IDP ensures that the data captured is accurate and consistent; crucial for patient safety and care quality,\nOrganising data in a searchable format to allow better data access.\nEnsuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA by securely managing sensitive patient data and providing audit trails.\nBenefits of IDP in healthcare\nThe implementation of IDP in healthcare comes with several benefits:\nIncreased efficiency: By automating routine tasks, healthcare providers can focus more on patient care rather than paperwork,\nCost reduction: IDP reduces the need for manual data entry and paper-based processes, leading to significant cost savings,\nBetter patient experience: Quick access to patient history and records leads to more informed decision-making and personalised care,\nScalability: As healthcare facilities grow, IDP systems can easily scale to manage increased data volumes without compromising performance.\nChallenges in implementing IDP\nWhile IDP offers many advantages, there are challenges to its adoption:\nIntegration with existing systems: Integrating IDP with current healthcare IT ecosystems can be complex and requires careful planning,\nData privacy concerns: Protecting patient data is paramount, and IDP must adhere to stringent security standards,\nChange management: Staff may resist shifting from manual to automated processes, necessitating adequate training and change management strategies.\nFuture of IDP in healthcare\nIn the future, IDP is likely to increase its impact in the healthcare field. Given the rise of AI and machine learning, the corresponding systems will become increasingly sophisticated, likely providing predictive analytics and decision support services. This could help improve diagnostic precision and create a more personalised patient treatment plan, eventually leading to better outcomes. In addition, IDP may facilitate data exchange between different healthcare systems.\nConclusion\nIntelligent document processing is a typical solution that is bound to become increasingly impactful in healthcare. It may help healthcare professionals deal more effectively with the contemporary challenges of patient data. Although challenges exist, the potential results of improved client care, decreased expenses, and more precise data make IDP an invaluable asset. Thus, it can be concluded that Intelligent Document Processing should be considered one of the healthcare industry\u2019s future solutions in its quest toward digitalisation.\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?\u00a0Check out\u00a0AI & Big Data Expo\u00a0taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Through micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses (which are quite expensive), Meta seems to have cracked a longstanding AR display challenge. The idea is that you can look through Orion \u2014 you know, like a pair of glasses \u2014 but also see application windows projected on the lenses that appear as if they\u2019re embedded in the world around you. Ideally, you can use your hands, eyes, and voice to navigate the environment.\nThe Orion smart glasses need a wristband and wireless compute puck to work.

We\u2019re talking years from now. All the technology in Orion is relatively young, and all of it needs to get cheaper, better, and smaller to work its way into a pair of smart glasses you can buy at the mall. Zuckerberg says the company has already been working on Orion for 10 years, but there\u2019s still no path to a sellable product.\nHowever, Meta is hardly the only company trying to put a smartphone replacement on your face.\nThis month, Snap unveiled its latest generation of Spectacles smart glasses, which are larger than Orion and have a more limited field of view. One former Snap engineer called the latest Spectacles \u201cobviously bad\u201d \u2014 though you can actually order them. Google hinted during its I/O conference in May that it, too, is working on a pair of smart glasses, perhaps a revamp of its failed Google Glass experiment from last decade. Apple is reportedly working on AR glasses that sound a lot like Orion. And we can\u2019t rule out Jony Ive\u2019s new startup, LoveFrom, which he recently confirmed is working on an AI wearable with OpenAI (though we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re glasses, a pin, or something else entirely).\nWhat\u2019s brewing is a race among Big Tech\u2019s richest companies to create a sleek pair of smart glasses that can do everything your smartphone can \u2014 and hopefully something more. Meta\u2019s prototype made two things clear: there is something there, but we\u2019re not \u201cthere\u201d yet.\nThese devices are a notable departure from the Quest virtual reality headsets Meta has been pushing for years now, and Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. There\u2019s a lot of similar technology involved, like eye-tracking and hand tracking, but they feel completely different to use. VR headsets are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make people nauseous from staring at the displays. Sunglasses and eyeglasses, on the other hand, are relatively pleasant to wear and millions of Americans use them everyday.\nTo Zuckerberg\u2019s credit, he\u2019s been pushing the eyewear form factor for quite a long time, when it certainly was not popular to do so. It\u2019s long been reported that Meta\u2019s CEO hates that his popular social media apps have to be accessed through Apple\u2019s phones (perhaps leading to the ill-fated Facebook Phone). Now, Meta\u2019s competitors are also dipping their toes into eyewear computing.\nAndrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta and head or Reality Labs, wearing a clear pair of Orion smart glasses.

Zuckerberg gave a keynote presentation of Orion on Wednesday that we won\u2019t be forgetting anytime soon, filling a room full of skeptical journalists with electricity and excitement. TechCrunch has not demoed Orion yet, but initial reviews have been very positive. \nWhat Meta offers today is the Ray-Ban Meta: a pair of glasses with cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, an on-device LLM, and the ability to connect to your phone and the cloud. The Ray-Ban Meta is far simpler than Orion, but relatively affordable at $299 \u2014 actually not much more than a regular pair of Ray-Bans. They\u2019re kind of like the Spectacles 3 that Snap released a few years ago, though the Ray-Ban Meta glasses appear more popular. \nDespite the vast differences in price and capabilities, Orion and Ray-Ban Meta are more related than you might think.\n\u201cOrion is really the future, and we ultimately want to go for the full holographic experience. You can think about Ray-Ban Meta as our first step there,\u201d said Li-Chen Miller, a VP of product at Meta who leads its wearables team, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cWe really need to nail the basic things, like making sure it\u2019s comfortable, people want to wear it, and that people find value in it every day.\u201d\nOne of the things Meta is trying to nail with Ray-Ban Meta is AI. Currently, the smart glasses use Meta\u2019s Llama models to answer questions about what you see in front of you, by taking pictures and running them through the AI system alongside a user\u2019s verbal requests. The Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s AI features today are far from perfect: The latency is worse than OpenAI\u2019s natural-feeling Advanced Voice Mode; Meta AI requires very specific prompts to work right; it hallucinates; and it doesn\u2019t have a tight integration with many apps, making it less useful than just picking up my iPhone (perhaps by Apple\u2019s design). But Meta\u2019s updates coming later this year try to address these issues.\nLi-Chen Miller, VP of product during Meta Connect in 2023. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nMeta announced it will soon release live AI video processing for their Ray-Bans, meaning the smart glasses will stream live video and verbal requests into one of Llama\u2019s multimodal AI models and will produce real-time, verbal answers based on that input. It\u2019s also getting basic features, like reminders, as well as more app integrations. That should make the whole experience a lot smoother, if it works. Miller says these improvements will filter up to Orion, which runs on the same generative AI systems.\n\u201cSome things make more sense for one form factor than the other, but we\u2019re certainly cross-pollinating,\u201d said Miller.\nLikewise, she says some of Orion\u2019s features may filter down as her team focuses on making the AR glasses more affordable. Orion\u2019s various sensors and eye trackers are not cheap technologies. The problem is that Orion has to get both better and more economical.\nAnother challenge is typing. Your smartphone has a keyboard, but your smart glasses won\u2019t. Miller worked on keyboards at Microsoft for nearly 20 years before joining Meta, but she says Orion\u2019s lack of keyboard is \u201cfreeing.\u201d She argues that using smart glasses will be a more natural experience than using a phone. You can simply talk, gesture with your hands, and look at things to navigate Orion; all things that come naturally to most people.\nAnother device that was criticized for lacking a keyboard was, ironically, the iPhone. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer infamously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, saying it wouldn\u2019t appeal to business customers because it didn\u2019t have a physical keyboard. People adapted though, and his comments sound naive more than 15 years later.\nI think making Orion feel natural is definitely more of a goal than a reality at this point. The Verge notes in its hands-on review that windows occasionally filled the entire glasses lens, completely obstructing the user\u2019s view of the world around them. That\u2019s far from natural. To get there, Meta will have to improve its AI, typing, AR, and a long list of other features.\n\u201cFor Ray-Ban Meta, we kept it very scoped to a few things, and then it does them really well,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWhereas, when you want to build a new, futuristic computing platform [with Orion], we have to do a lot of things, and do them all very well.\u201d\""}

Called symbolic AI, it uses rules pertaining to particular tasks, like rewriting lines of text, to solve larger problems.\nSymbolic AI can deftly tackle some problems that neural networks struggle with. And recent  research has shown that it can be scalable. (Historically, symbolic architectures haven\u2019t been compute-efficient.)\nThe scalability breakthroughs have fueled a wellspring of startups applying symbolic AI to various domains, like Orby and TekTonic (which are building enterprise automation tools), Symbolica, and Unlikely AI (founded by Alexa co-creator William Tunstall-Pedoe). One of the newest ventures to emerge from stealth is Augmented Intelligence, backed by $44 million from investors including former IBM President Jim Whitehurst.\nAugmented Intelligence builds conversational AI that it claims is both more predictable and \u201cagentic\u201d \u2014 the latest AI buzzword du jour \u2014 than your typical neural network-based system. For example, instead of simply answering a question about flights to Mexico with instructions on how to book, Augmented Intelligence\u2019s AI can give a list of fares and book the flight for you, CEO Ohad Elhelo says.\nBut wait \u2014 can\u2019t ChatGPT already do that? Yes, Elhelo admits. But he claims that it requires more setup and manual integration than Augmented Intelligence\u2019s tech.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between chatbots like ChatGPT, whose primary goal is to chat with the user, and conversational agents that take actions or work on behalf of companies,\u201d Elhelo told TechCrunch. \u201cOnce you connect the AI to tools \u2014 either to retrieve information or to act \u2014 the model is not relying anymore on its training data, and the quality of intelligence drops dramatically.\u201d\nElhelo co-founded Augmented Intelligence with Ori Cohen in 2017. Back then, the company had a different name \u2014 Delegate (and before that, Stuff) \u2014 and had a different, more polarizing mission: providing an AI-powered app where customers could delegate tasks to low-paid gig workers. \nElhelo gave the elevator pitch for Delegate in a 2019 interview: \u201cIf an hour of [a business exec\u2019s] time is worth, let\u2019s say $50, why spend it on the phone with customer service or reading online customer reviews when there\u2019s someone else in India, East Jerusalem, or the Philippines willing to do it for much less?\u201d\nDelegate\u2019s scathing Glassdoor reviews suggest that it was difficult for gig workers to make much money at all. Workers complain of bugs and a \u201cwaitlising\u201d system that made the platform difficult to use, little-to-no support or training, and an incentive structure that dangled the promise of higher pay but rarely awarded it.\nSo \u2014 under pressure to pivot \u2014 Elhelo and Cohen embraced the AI route. \nAugmented Intelligence\u2019s AI can power chatbots that answer questions about any number of topics (e.g. \u201cDo you price match on this product?\u201d), integrating with a company\u2019s existing APIs and workflows. Elhelo claims the AI was trained on conversation data from tens of thousands of human customer service agents. \nI asked Elhelo if the conversations came from Delegate. He wouldn\u2019t say \u2014 nor would he say whether any agents were paid for their contributions, or whether agents were informed that their data would be used in this way.\nSetting aside for a moment peoples\u2019 feelings on brand chatbots, why would a company choose Augmented Intelligence over another AI vendor? Well, for one, Elhelo says that its AI is trained to use tools to bring in info from outside sources to complete tasks. AI from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others can similarly make use of tools, but Elhelo claims that Augmented Intelligence\u2019s AI performs better than neural network-driven solutions.\nThe AI is also more explainable because it provides a log of how it responded to queries and why, Elhelo asserts \u2014 giving companies a way to fine-tune and improve its performance. And it doesn\u2019t train on a company\u2019s data, using only the resources it\u2019s been given permission to access for specific contexts, Elhelo says.\n\u201cAugmented Intelligence does not require training on company information,\u201d Elhelo said, \u201cand takes into consideration the deploying company\u2019s rule-based instructions.\u201d\nThat bit about not training on customer data will surely appeal to businesses wary of exposing secrets to a third-party AI. Apple, among others, reportedly banned staff from using OpenAI tools last year, citing concerns about confidential data leakage.\nNow, Elhelo makes some dubious claims, like that Augmented Intelligence\u2019s AI can \u201celiminate hallucinations\u201d (it most certainly cannot). But the 40-employee company appears to be winning business nonetheless, most recently securing a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to bring its models to the platform.\nElhelo wouldn\u2019t share info on revenue. But he did tell TechCrunch that Augmented Intelligence\u2019s last $10 million fundraising round, led by New Era Capital Partners, valued it at $350 million \u2014 a relatively high figure for an AI vendor that only recently brought its product to market (and wasn\u2019t founded by a titan of the AI industry).\n\u201cTraditional models excel at pattern recognition and language generation,\u201d Elhelo said. \u201cHowever, these architectures fall short in situations where the model needs to perform actions, make decisions, or interact with tools. Apollo\u2019s neuro-symbolic architecture and possibilities it unlocks for companies solves those problems.\u201d\nMore TechCrunch\nGet the industry\u2019s biggest tech news\nExplore all newsletters\nTechCrunch Daily News\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.\nStartups Weekly\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\nTechCrunch Fintech\nThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.\nTechCrunch Mobility\nTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.\nEmail address (required)\nSubscribe\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\nTags\nAI, AI, App, Apps, augmented intelligence, chatbot, Enterprise, Enterprise, Generative AI, startup, symbolic ai \n        AI\n\nAugmented Intelligence claims its symbolic AI can make chatbots more useful\nKyle Wiggers\n45 seconds ago\nAugmented Intelligence claims that its \u2018symbolic AI\u2019 techniques can help lead to better chatbot experiences. \nImage Credits: BlackJack3D / Getty Images\n        Startups\n\nAirship wants to build better sales tools for HVAC contractors\nRebecca Szkutak\n58 mins ago\nThe HVAC industry is going through a transformation.

In just the last five years, we\u2019ve probably heard too much about the metaverse, blockchain and virtual reality, for example. At present, we\u2019re in the midst of a furore about the much-abused term \u2018AI\u2019, and time will tell whether this particular storm will be seen as a teacup resident.\nArtificial Intelligence News spoke exclusively to Jon McLoone, the Director of Technical Communication and Strategy at of one the most mature organisations in the computational intelligence and scientific innovation space, Wolfram Research, to help us put our present concepts of AI and their practical uses into a deeper context.\nJon has worked at Wolfram Research for 32 years in various roles, currently leading the European Technical Services team. A mathematician by training and a skilled practitioner in many aspects of data analysis, we began our interview by having him describe Wolfram\u2019s work in an elevator pitch format.\nJon McLoone\n\u201cOur value proposition is that we know computation and Wolfram technology. We tailor our technology to the problem that an organisation has. That\u2019s across a broad range of things. So, we don\u2019t have a typical customer. What they have in common is they\u2019re doing something innovative.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing problem-solving, the type of things that use computation and data science. We\u2019re building out a unified platform for computation, and when we talk about computation, we mean the kinds of technical computing, like engineering calculations, data science and machine learning. It\u2019s things like social network analysis, biosciences, actuarial science, and financial computations. Abstractly, these are all fundamentally mathematical things.\u201d\n\u201cOur world is all those structured areas where we\u2019ve spent 30 years building out different ontologies. We have a symbolic representation of the maths, but also things like graphs and networks, documents, videos, images, audio, time series, entities in the real world, like cities, rivers, and mountains. My team is doing the fun stuff of actually making it do something useful!\u201d\n\u201cAI we just see as another kind of computation. There were different algorithms that have been developed over years, some of them hundreds of years ago, some of them only tens of years ago. Gen AI just adds to this list.\u201d\nClaims made about AI in 2024 can sometimes be overoptimistic, so we need to be realistic about its capabilities and consider what it excels at and where it falls short.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still human intelligence, which still remains as the strategic element. You\u2019re not going to say, in the next five years AI will run my company and make decisions. Generative AI is very fluent but is unreliable. Its job is to be plausible, not to be correct. And particularly when you get into the kinds of things Wolfram does, it\u2019s terrible because it will tell you the kinds of things that your mathematical answer would look like.\u201d (Artificial Intelligence News\u2018 italics.)\nThe work of Wolfram Research in this context focuses on what Jon terms \u2018symbolic AI\u2019. To differentiate generative and symbolic AI, he gave us the analogy of modelling the trajectory of a thrown ball. A generative AI would learn how the ball travels by examining many thousands of such throws and then be able to produce a description of the trajectory. \u201cThat description would be plausible. That kind of model is data-rich, understanding poor.\u201d\nA symbolic representation of the thrown ball, on the other hand, would involve differential equations for projectile motion and representations of elements: mass, viscosity of the atmosphere, friction, and many other factors. \u201cIt could then be asked, \u2018What happens if I throw the ball on Mars?\u2019 It\u2019ll say something accurate. It\u2019s not going to fail.\u201d\nThe ideal way to solve business (or scientific, medical, or engineering) problems is a combination of human intelligence, symbolic reasoning, as epitomised in Wolfram Language, and what we now term AI acting as the glue between them. AI is a great technology for interpreting meaning and acting as an interface between the component parts.\n\u201cSome of the interesting crossovers are where we take natural language and turn that into some structured information that you can then compute with. Human language is very messy and ambiguous, and generative AI is very good at mapping that to some structure. Once you\u2019re in a structured world of something that is syntactically formal, then you can do things on it.\u201d\nA recent example of combining \u2018traditional\u2019 AI with the work of Wolfram involved medical records:\n\u201cWe did a project recently taking medical reports, which were handwritten, typed and digital. But they contain words, and trying to do statistics on those isn\u2019t possible. And so, you\u2019ve got to use the generative AI part for mapping all of these words to things like classes: was this an avoidable death? Yes. No. That\u2019s a nice, structured key value pair. And then once we\u2019ve got that information in structured form (for example a piece of JSON or XML, or whatever your chosen structure), we can then do classical statistics to start saying, \u2018Is there a trend? Can we project? Was there an impact from COVID on hospital harms?\u2019 Clear-cut questions that you can approach symbolically with things like means and medians and models.\u201d\nDuring our interview, Jon also gave a pr\u00e9cis of a presentation, which took as its example of his organisation\u2019s work, an imaginary peanut butter cup manufacturing plant. What might be the effects of changing out a particular ingredient or altering some detail of the recipe and the effects of that change on the product\u2019s shelf life?\n\u201cLLMs (large language models) will say, \u2018Oh, they\u2019ll probably last a few weeks because peanut butter cups usually sit on the shelf a few weeks. But going to a computational model that can plug into the ingredients, and compute, and you\u2019ll know this thing should last for eight weeks before it goes off. Or what that change might do to the manufacturing process? A computational model can connect to the digital twin of your manufacturing plant and learn, \u2018That will slow things down by 3%, so your productivity will fall by 20% because it creates a bottleneck here.\u2019 LLMs are great at connecting you and your question to the model, maths, data science or the database. And that\u2019s really an interesting three-way meeting of minds.\u201d\nYou can catch Wolfram Research at the upcoming TechEx event in Amsterdam, October 1-2, at stand 166 of the AI & Big Data strand. We can\u2019t guarantee any peanut butter-related discussion at the event, but to discover how powerful modelling and generative AI can be harnessed to solve your specific problems and quandaries, contact the company via its website.\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?\u00a0Check out\u00a0AI & Big Data Expo\u00a0taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.\nAs AI reshapes the digital landscape, tech companies find themselves in a high-stakes game of regulatory chess, with each move potentially changing the possibilities stemming from innovation. The game board is especially intricate for global infrastructure providers like Cloudflare, involving as it does cybersecurity, data privacy, and content moderation in a complex policy framework.\n\u201cNo one wants to miss the boat,\u201d says Alissa Starzak, the company\u2019s deputy chief legal officer and global head of public policy, referring to the rush to regulate AI. Yet, she cautions the tension between urgent action and measured response that encapsulates the complex balancing act Cloudflare navigates daily.\nIn a recent interview with Artificial Intelligence News, Starzak revealed how the internet infrastructure giant is working to shape a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while safeguarding against emerging cyber threats.\nThe AI regulatory conundrum: Speed vs.\u00a0caution\nRegulators worldwide face the question of how to mandate as AI technology advances. Urgency is muted by a significant fact: the main dimensions of potential AI are not fully understood yet. \u201cNo one really knows yet,\u201d Starzak said, highlighting the challenge of crafting regulations for a technology with unknown scope.\nA lack of knowledge has led to producing responsible AI development and deployment frameworks that are speculative. An example would be the AI risk framework set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u00a0(NIST), which Starzak said were meaningful steps towards the goal. Voluntary guidelines provide companies with a roadmap for creating AI risk assessment measures and encourage them to do so without stifling innovation.\nThe tightrope of global regulatory harmonisation\nCloudflare is congnisant of the complexities of achieving regulatory harmony across different jurisdictions, particularly in data protection and privacy. Starzak used the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to illustrate the benefits and challenges of sweeping regulatory frameworks.\nIt is noteworthy that GDPR has a significant role in consolidating privacy norms internationally. Starzak said that its real-life application does not always harmonise with the functioning of the internet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually feel like the way the internet necessarily works in practice,\u201d she said, referring to restrictions on data transfers between jurisdictions.\nThis disconnect highlights a broader challenge: crafting regulations that protect consumers and national interests without impeding the global nature of the internet and digital commerce. Starzak emphasised the need for regulatory mechanisms that are \u201cconsistent across jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but enable information to travel.\u201d\nThe imperative of targeted, narrow actions\nStarzak advocates for a more nuanced, targeted approach to cybersecurity measures and content moderation. Her philosophy is rooted in recognising that broad, sweeping actions often have unintended consequences that can harm the ecosystem they aim to protect.\nIn terms of cybersecurity, Starzak stressed the importance of proportionality. She drew a stark contrast between targeted actions, like removing a specific piece of content, and drastic measures, like complete internet shutdowns. \u201cThe narrower that you can go, the better off you\u2019re going to be from an open internet standpoint,\u201d she said.\nThe principle extends to content moderation as well. As Starzak describes, the approach by Cloudflare involves carefully distinguishing between different types of services and their impacts. By doing so, the company aims to make more precise, effective decisions that address specific issues without unnecessarily compromising the broader internet ecosystem.\nBalancing innovation and regulation in AI\nThe rapid advancement of AI technology presents a unique regulatory challenge. Starzak highlighted the risk of over-regulation stifling innovation and concentrating power in the hands of a few large players. \u201cIf you regulate it too much, you restrict the industry in a very significant way and make it really only available to a very small number of players,\u201d she said.\nStarzak advocates a regulatory approach that encourages responsible innovation while addressing potential harms. This includes promoting the development and adoption of AI risk assessment frameworks and encouraging industry self-regulation through model testing and \u2018red teaming.\u2019\nThe path forward: collaboration and flexibility\nStarzak emphasises the need for ongoing dialogue and flexibility in regulatory approaches to AI and cybersecurity. She highlighted the importance of industry, government, and civil society collaboration to develop effective, balanced regulations.\nAccording to Starzak, the key is to focus on specific harms and consumer protection rather than broad, sweeping regulations. \u201cYou have to go in with a purpose,\u201d she stated, urging regulators to understand and articulate the problems they\u2019re trying to solve.\nA targeted approach, combined with willingness to adapt as technologies evolve offers a path forward through the complex internet and AI regulation world. As Cloudflare continues to navigate this landscape, Starzak\u2019s insights provide a roadmap for balancing innovation, security, and responsible governance.\nAs the tech industry and regulators grapple with the challenge of creating effective governance frameworks, Cloudflare\u2019s approach emphasises targeted actions, global harmonisation efforts, and regulatory flexibility. It represents a thoughtful perspective in the dialogue between tech companies and policymakers.\nThe way forward likely involves collaborative efforts from various stakeholders, including industry leaders, government bodies, and civil society organisations. The focus remains on striking a balance between protecting users and fostering innovation. This goal requires ongoing adaptation and cooperation across the tech ecosystem.\nSee\u00a0also:\u00a0Balancing innovation and trust: Experts assess the EU\u2019s AI Act\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social) \nAhead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, AI News caught up with Ivo Everts, Senior Solutions Architect at Databricks, to discuss several key developments set to shape the future of open-source AI and data governance. \nOne of Databricks\u2019 notable achievements is the DBRX model, which set a new standard for open large language models (LLMs). \n\u201cUpon release, DBRX outperformed all other leading open models on standard benchmarks and has up to 2x faster inference than models like Llama2-70B,\u201d Everts explains. \u201cIt was trained more efficiently due to a variety of technological advances. \n\u201cFrom a quality standpoint, we believe that DBRX is one of the best open-source models out there and when we refer to \u2018best\u2019 this means a wide range of industry benchmarks, including language understanding (MMLU), Programming (HumanEval), and Math (GSM8K).\u201d \nThe open-source AI model aims to \u201cdemocratise the training of custom LLMs beyond a small handful of model providers and show organisations that they can train world-class LLMs on their data in a cost-effective way.\u201d \nIn line with their commitment to open ecosystems, Databricks has also open-sourced Unity Catalog. \n\u201cOpen-sourcing Unity Catalog enhances its adoption across cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) and on-premise infrastructures,\u201d Everts notes. \u201cThis flexibility allows organisations to uniformly apply data governance policies regardless of where the data is stored or processed.\u201d \nUnity Catalog addresses the challenges of data sprawl and inconsistent access controls through various features: \nCentralised data access management: \u201cUnity Catalog centralises the governance of data assets, allowing organisations to manage access controls in a unified manner,\u201d Everts states. \nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): According to Everts, Unity Catalog \u201cimplements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing organisations to assign roles and permissions based on user profiles.\u201d \nData lineage and auditing: This feature \u201chelps organisations monitor data usage and dependencies, making it easier to identify and eliminate redundant or outdated data,\u201d Everts explains. He adds that it also \u201clogs all data access and changes, providing a detailed audit trail to ensure compliance with data security policies.\u201d \nCross-cloud and hybrid support: Everts points out that Unity Catalog \u201cis designed to manage data governance in multi-cloud and hybrid environments\u201d and \u201censures that data is governed uniformly, regardless of where it resides.\u201d \nThe company has introduced Databricks AI/BI, a new business intelligence product that leverages generative AI to enhance data exploration and visualisation. Everts believes that \u201ca truly intelligent BI solution needs to understand the unique semantics and nuances of a business to effectively answer questions for business users.\u201d \nThe AI/BI system includes two key components: \nDashboards: Everts describes this as \u201can AI-powered, low-code interface for creating and distributing fast, interactive dashboards.\u201d These include \u201cstandard BI features like visualisations, cross-filtering, and periodic reports without needing additional management services.\u201d \nGenie: Everts explains this as \u201ca conversational interface for addressing ad-hoc and follow-up questions through natural language.\u201d He adds that it \u201clearns from underlying data to generate adaptive visualisations and suggestions in response to user queries, improving over time through feedback and offering tools for analysts to refine its outputs.\u201d \nEverts states that Databricks AI/BI is designed to provide \u201ca deep understanding of your data\u2019s semantics, enabling self-service data analysis for everyone in an organisation.\u201d He notes it\u2019s powered by \u201ca compound AI system that continuously learns from usage across an organisation\u2019s entire data stack, including ETL pipelines, lineage, and other queries.\u201d \nDatabricks also unveiled Mosaic AI, which Everts describes as \u201ca comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning and generative AI applications, integrating enterprise data for enhanced performance and governance.\u201d \nMosaic AI offers several key components, which Everts outlines: \nUnified tooling: Provides \u201ctools for building, deploying, evaluating, and governing AI and ML solutions, supporting predictive models and generative AI applications.\u201d \nGenerative AI patterns: \u201cSupports prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and pre-training, offering flexibility as business needs evolve.\u201d \nCentralised model management: \u201cModel Serving allows for centralised deployment, governance, and querying of AI models, including custom ML models and foundation models.\u201d \nMonitoring and governance: \u201cLakehouse Monitoring and Unity Catalog ensure comprehensive monitoring, governance, and lineage tracking across the AI lifecycle.\u201d \nCost-effective custom LLMs: \u201cEnables training and serving custom large language models at significantly lower costs, tailored to specific organisational domains.\u201d \nEverts highlights that Mosaic AI\u2019s approach to fine-tuning and customising foundation models includes unique features like \u201cfast startup times\u201d by \u201cutilising in-cluster base model caching,\u201d \u201clive prompt evaluation\u201d where users can \u201ctrack how the model\u2019s responses change throughout the training process,\u201d and support for \u201ccustom pre-trained checkpoints.\u201d \nAt the heart of these innovations lies the Data Intelligence Platform, which Everts says \u201ctransforms data management by using AI models to gain deep insights into the semantics of enterprise data.\u201d The platform combines features of data lakes and data warehouses, utilises Delta Lake technology for real-time data processing, and incorporates Delta Sharing for secure data exchange across organisational boundaries. \nEverts explains that the Data Intelligence Platform plays a crucial role in supporting new AI and data-sharing initiatives by providing: \nA unified data and AI platform that \u201ccombines the features of data lakes and data warehouses into a single architecture.\u201d \nDelta Lake for real-time data processing, ensuring \u201creliable data governance, ACID transactions, and real-time data processing.\u201d \nCollaboration and data sharing via Delta Sharing, enabling \u201csecure and open data sharing across organisational boundaries.\u201d \nIntegrated support for machine learning and AI model development with popular libraries like MLflow, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. \nScalability and performance through its cloud-native architecture and the Photon engine, \u201can optimised query execution engine.\u201d \nAs a key sponsor of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Databricks plans to showcase their open-source AI and data governance solutions during the event. \n\u201cAt our stand, we will also showcase how to create and deploy \u2013 with Lakehouse apps \u2013 a custom GenAI app from scratch using open-source models from Hugging Face and data from Unity Catalog,\u201d says Everts. \n\u201cWith our GenAI app you can generate your own cartoon picture, all running on the Data Intelligence Platform.\u201d \nDatabricks will be sharing more of their expertise at this year\u2019s AI & Big Data Expo Europe.

Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers today, and Enterprise and Edu customers will likely get the feature next week. The feature is fully functional on desktops\u2014mobile users can only view the canvas projects for now.During a prelaunch demo to WIRED, Levine focused on a hope for more \u201cnatural\u201d feeling human-AI collaboration with this new option. His team used synthetic data generated by OpenAI\u2019s latest model, o1-preview, to give GPT-4o\u2019s model useful canvas features, like knowing when to activate and how much to adjust the document.With canvas, ChatGPT can generate a starting draft of a project for you and the AI to edit together, or you can paste an existing draft of what you\u2019re working on for feedback. Levine started off by asking ChatGPT to use canvas to help draft a crucial email. He followed up by highlighting a couple of paragraphs and requesting specific changes. The generative AI tool is able to add comments in the canvas to note potential improvements or can even directly change what\u2019s in the document.Courtesy of OpenAI.Opening a canvas is simple: Just add a phrase like \u201cuse canvas \u2026\u201d or \u201cstart a canvas \u2026\u201d to your prompt and the new window will appear. For some writing prompts, like requests to generate a draft blog post, the GPT-4o model is trained to launch a canvas without you even invoking the tool, if it's deemed helpful. For coding projects, the model only starts a canvas when directly requested.Most PopularGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasBy Scott GilbertsonGearHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Polestar?By Carlton ReidGearEverything Apple Announced TodayBy Boone AshworthGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple\u2019s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuAlthough both writing and coding modes give the choice of requesting in-line edits, the bifurcated user interface for canvas is designed with one additional set of shortcuts for those focused on AI-assisted writing and another for coders. In the demo, Levine showed off how the writer\u2019s shortcut could be used to condense the number of words in a canvas or attempt to perform a \u201cfinal polish\u201d on the draft. He also used one of the more lighthearted shortcuts to add a bunch of random emoji. On the coder\u2019s side, ChatGPT can add logs, comments, and attempt to troubleshoot problems in a canvas.ChatGPT saves different versions of the canvas as you\u2019re iterating, so you can return to old versions if you end up preferring that output. Writers who may be worried about what they upload being used by OpenAI to train its model should go into their user settings and make sure that \u201cmodel training\u201d is toggled off.By allowing ChatGPT to make edits as well as suggestions, OpenAI is blurring the line between authorship and word curation. As someone who works with professional editors daily, I\u2019m skeptical the canvas beta will match their incisive notes and careful guidance. But for people who don\u2019t have easy access to human writing partners, I can see how getting synthetic notes on a composition about structure and content would be beneficial.It\u2019s worth noting that three people listed as \u201csupporting leadership\u201d on the canvas project are no longer with the company. Former post-training colead and cofounder John Schulman left in August and now works at Anthropic, a rival AI company. Additionally, former chief technology officer Mira Murati and research vice president Barret Zoph both stepped down from their positions a week before this launch. At a press event in the OpenAI office after the departures, current chief product officer Kevin Weil reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to continue releasing software.\u201cI think 2025 is gonna be the year that agentic systems finally hit the mainstream,\u201d he says. The idea of an AI \u201cagent\u201d that can not only work through software tasks alongside you, but is also nimble enough to be sent off into the digital wilderness to do things on your behalf, is simultaneously generative AI\u2019s recent past and projected future.Last year, WIRED covered ChatGPT\u2019s plug-ins people could use for tasks, like booking flights with Expedia or making a reservation with OpenTable\u2014arguably a step toward more \u201cagentic\u201d AI tools. However, plug-ins were later wound down, with more limited custom GPT chatbots launched in their place.Keeping that in mind, the beta release of canvas does appear to be another attempt at augmenting AI models with more decisionmaking abilities, which can lead to surprises. During one of WIRED\u2019s demos, Levine highlighted a portion of the canvas and requested an edit, and ChatGPT subsequently made an in-line change near the bottom, outside his highlight. \u201cThe really interesting thing is oftentimes, if you highlight a section, it will make an edit in that part,\u201d he says. \u201cBut ChatGPT has the option to decide where to edit.\u201dThe closest alternative to OpenAI\u2019s canvas tool available right now is probably Google\u2019s Gemini integration that lets you use generative AI inside of Docs or Anthropic's Artifacts tool. Chatbots definitely aren\u2019t dead, but AI companies are now acknowledging the format\u2019s constraints and looking for ways to diversify their software to uncover novel, sticky user interfaces. Google recently received praise in tech circles for its entertaining AI podcasts\u2014even CEO Sam Altman lauded the tool.With billions of investment dollars still flowing through Silicon Valley to AI companies, consumers can expect to see more of these structural experiments that build on existing tools, like AI podcast hosts and AI document editors, to be released with a regular cadence over the next year. The chatbot race is far from over, and future iterations on the technology are likely to stray far away from that drab chatbox, and toward a more multifaceted approach.You Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoReece Rogers is WIRED's service writer, focused on explaining crucial topics and helping readers get the most out of their technology.

Now it will work with video and voice, too.Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoSave this storySaveSave this storySaveWhen Google Lens was introduced in 2017, the search feature accomplished a feat that not too long ago would have seemed like the stuff of science fiction: Point your phone\u2019s camera at an object and Google Lens can identify it, show some context, maybe even let you buy it. It was a new way of searching, one that didn\u2019t involve awkwardly typing out descriptions of things you were seeing in front of you.Lens also demonstrated how Google planned to use its machine learning and AI tools to ensure its search engine shows up on every possible surface. As Google increasingly uses its foundational generative AI models to generate summaries of information in response to text searches, Google Lens\u2019 visual search has been evolving, too. And now the company says Lens, which powers around 20 billion searches per month, is going to support even more ways to search, including video and multimodal searches.Another tweak to Lens means even more context for shopping will show up in results. Shopping is, unsurprisingly, one of the key use cases for Lens; Amazon and Pinterest also have visual search tools designed to fuel more buying. Search for your friend\u2019s sneakers in the old Google Lens, and you might have been shown a carousel of similar items. In the updated version of Lens, Google says it will show more direct links for purchasing, customer reviews, publisher reviews, and comparative shopping tools.Courtesy of GoogleLens search is now multimodal, a hot word in AI these days, which means people can now search with a combination of video, images, and voice inputs. Instead of pointing their smartphone camera at an object, tapping the focus point on the screen, and waiting for the Lens app to drum up results, users can point the lens and use voice commands at the same time, for example, \u201cWhat kind of clouds are those?\u201d or \u201cWhat brand of sneakers are those and where can I buy them?\u201dLens will also start working over real-time video capture, taking the tool a step beyond identifying objects in still images. If you have a broken record player or see a flashing light on a malfunctioning appliance at home, you could snap a quick video through Lens and, through a generative AI overview, see tips on how to repair the item.First announced at I/O, this feature is considered experimental and is available only to people who have opted into Google\u2019s search labs, says Rajan Patel, an 18-year Googler and a cofounder of Lens. The other Google Lens features, voice mode and expanded shopping, are rolling out more broadly.The \u201cvideo understanding\u201d feature, as Google calls it, is intriguing for a few reasons. While it currently works with video captured in real time, if or when Google expands it to captured videos, entire repositories of videos\u2014whether in a person\u2019s own camera roll or in a gargantuan database like Google\u2014could potentially become taggable and overwhelmingly shoppable.Courtesy of GoogleThe second consideration is that this Lens feature shares some characteristics with Google\u2019s Project Astra, which is expected to be available later this year. Astra, like Lens, uses multimodal inputs to interpret the world around you through your phone. As part of an Astra demo this spring, the company showed off a pair of prototype smart glasses.Separately, Meta just made a splash with its long-term vision for our augmented reality future, which involves mere mortals wearing dorky glasses that can smartly interpret the world around them and show them holographic interfaces. Google, of course, already tried to realize this future with Google Glass (which uses fundamentally different technology than that of Meta\u2019s latest pitch). Are Lens\u2019 new features, coupled with Astra, a natural segue to a new kind of smart glasses?Most PopularScience23andMe Is Sinking Fast.

How can we answer questions more seamlessly? And what are all the capabilities we need to build?\u2019\u201d Patel says. \u201cAll of these are building blocks.\u201dLastly, and critically, having the ability to shoot video of the scene around you and immediately tap into the world\u2019s database of information has some obvious and concerning privacy implications. Already a group of students claim to have adapted Meta\u2019s widely available smart glasses with facial recognition technology and used the glasses to identify strangers.If you use Google Lens on your smartphone to capture a real-time video of a group of people dancing in a park\u2014or, say, protesting in the streets\u2014how will Lens process that information? Will it be capable of identifying the people in the frame?Patel says Len\u2019s default will be to process, frame-to-frame, the context of the scene, \u201cdoing our best to ignore people\u2019s faces\u201d and instead identifying the location of the scene, or the song that\u2019s playing, or, in some cases, the clothing people are wearing. (Always be shopping.)Lens may be trained to \u201cdo its best to ignore faces,\u201d but it\u2019s still a visual search tool that works by capturing images and videos that could include humans. Lens\u2019 search may get better at answering our questions, but it also asks a massive one of its users, which is whether we can trust it.You Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoLauren Goode is a senior writer at WIRED covering Big Tech, Silicon Valley\u2019s most interesting people, emerging trends in the tech industry, and how the culture of Silicon Valley influences the products we use.

Now it will work with video and voice, too.\nPhotograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nSave this story\nSave\nSave this story\nSave\nWhen Google Lens was introduced in 2017, the search feature accomplished a feat that not too long ago would have seemed like the stuff of science fiction: Point your phone\u2019s camera at an object and Google Lens can identify it, show some context, maybe even let you buy it. It was a new way of searching, one that didn\u2019t involve awkwardly typing out descriptions of things you were seeing in front of you.\nLens also demonstrated how Google planned to use its machine learning and AI tools to ensure its search engine shows up on every possible surface. As Google increasingly uses its foundational generative AI models to generate summaries of information in response to text searches, Google Lens\u2019 visual search has been evolving, too. And now the company says Lens, which powers around 20 billion searches per month, is going to support even more ways to search, including video and multimodal searches.\nAnother tweak to Lens means even more context for shopping will show up in results. Shopping is, unsurprisingly, one of the key use cases for Lens; Amazon and Pinterest also have visual search tools designed to fuel more buying. Search for your friend\u2019s sneakers in the old Google Lens, and you might have been shown a carousel of similar items. In the updated version of Lens, Google says it will show more direct links for purchasing, customer reviews, publisher reviews, and comparative shopping tools.\nCourtesy of Google\nLens search is now multimodal, a hot word in AI these days, which means people can now search with a combination of video, images, and voice inputs. Instead of pointing their smartphone camera at an object, tapping the focus point on the screen, and waiting for the Lens app to drum up results, users can point the lens and use voice commands at the same time, for example, \u201cWhat kind of clouds are those?\u201d or \u201cWhat brand of sneakers are those and where can I buy them?\u201d\nLens will also start working over real-time video capture, taking the tool a step beyond identifying objects in still images. If you have a broken record player or see a flashing light on a malfunctioning appliance at home, you could snap a quick video through Lens and, through a generative AI overview, see tips on how to repair the item.\nFirst announced at I/O, this feature is considered experimental and is available only to people who have opted into Google\u2019s search labs, says Rajan Patel, an 18-year Googler and a cofounder of Lens. The other Google Lens features, voice mode and expanded shopping, are rolling out more broadly.\nThe \u201cvideo understanding\u201d feature, as Google calls it, is intriguing for a few reasons. While it currently works with video captured in real time, if or when Google expands it to captured videos, entire repositories of videos\u2014whether in a person\u2019s own camera roll or in a gargantuan database like Google\u2014could potentially become taggable and overwhelmingly shoppable.\nCourtesy of Google\nThe second consideration is that this Lens feature shares some characteristics with Google\u2019s Project Astra, which is expected to be available later this year. Astra, like Lens, uses multimodal inputs to interpret the world around you through your phone. As part of an Astra demo this spring, the company showed off a pair of prototype smart glasses.\nSeparately, Meta just made a splash with its long-term vision for our augmented reality future, which involves mere mortals wearing dorky glasses that can smartly interpret the world around them and show them holographic interfaces. Google, of course, already tried to realize this future with Google Glass (which uses fundamentally different technology than that of Meta\u2019s latest pitch). Are Lens\u2019 new features, coupled with Astra, a natural segue to a new kind of smart glasses?\nMost Popular\nScience\n23andMe Is Sinking Fast.

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nA new study by researchers at King\u2019s Business School and Wazoku has revealed that AI is transforming global problem-solving.\nThe report found that nearly half (46%) of Wazoku\u2019s 700,000-strong network of problem solvers had utilised generative AI (GenAI) to work on innovative ideas over the past year. This network \u2013 known as the Wazoku Crowd \u2013 comprises a diverse group of professionals including scientists, pharmacists, engineers, PhD students, CEOs, start-ups, and business leaders.\nPerhaps more strikingly, almost a quarter (22%) of respondents reported using GenAI or LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Claude for at least half of their idea submissions, with 8% employing these technologies for every single submission. Of those using GenAI, 47% are leveraging it specifically for idea generation.\nThe Wazoku Crowd\u2019s collective intelligence is harnessed to solve \u2018challenges\u2019 \u2013 requests for ideas submitted by enterprises \u2013 with an impressive success rate of over 80%.\nSimon Hill, CEO of Wazoku, commented on the findings: \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible amount of hype with GenAI, but alongside that there is enormous curiosity. Getting immersed in something and being curious is an innovator\u2019s dream, so there is rich potential with GenAI.\u201d\nHowever, Hill also urged caution: \u201cA note of caution, though \u2013 it is best used to generate interest, not solutions. Human ingenuity and creativity are still best, although using GenAI can undoubtedly make that process more effective.\u201d\nThe study revealed that the most common application of GenAI was in research and learning, with 85% of respondents using it for this purpose. Additionally, around one-third of the Wazoku Crowd employed GenAI for report structuring, writing, and data analysis and insight.\nThe research was conducted in partnership with Oguz A. Acar, Professor of Marketing and Innovation at King\u2019s Business School, King\u2019s College London. Professor Acar viewed the study as a crucial first step towards understanding AI\u2019s potential and limitations in tackling complex innovation challenges.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to figure out what AI can and can\u2019t do, and this survey is a step forward in understanding that,\u201d Professor Acar stated. \u201cIt reveals that some crowd members view GenAI as a valuable ally, using it to research, create, and communicate more effectively.\u201d\n\u201cWhile perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that those open to innovation are curious about new tools, the survey also shows mixed opinions. Most people haven\u2019t used GenAI tools yet, highlighting that we\u2019re only beginning to uncover AI\u2019s potential in innovative problem-solving.\u201d\nWazoku collaborates with a range of customers, including Sanofi, A2A, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and numerous global enterprise businesses, government departments, and not-for-profits, to crowdsource ideas and innovation.\nRecently, Wazoku launched its own conversational AI to aid innovation. Dubbed Jen AI, this digital innovation assistant has access to Wazoku\u2019s connected innovation management suite\u2014aimed at accelerating decision-making around innovation and enhancing productivity to deliver consistent, scalable results.\n\u201cThe solutions to the world\u2019s problems are complex, and the support of AI brings vast benefits in terms of efficiency, creativity, and insight generation,\u201d explained Hill.\nAs the adoption of AI in innovation processes continues to grow, it\u2019s clear that \u2013 while these tools offer significant potential \u2013 they are best used to augment rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving skills.\n(Photo by Ally Griffin)\nSee also: Ivo Everts, Databricks: Enhancing open-source AI and improving data governance\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\nA new study by researchers at King\u2019s Business School and Wazoku has revealed that AI is transforming global problem-solving.\nThe report found that nearly half (46%) of Wazoku\u2019s 700,000-strong network of problem solvers had utilised generative AI (GenAI) to work on innovative ideas over the past year. This network \u2013 known as the Wazoku Crowd \u2013 comprises a diverse group of professionals including scientists, pharmacists, engineers, PhD students, CEOs, start-ups, and business leaders.\nPerhaps more strikingly, almost a quarter (22%) of respondents reported using GenAI or LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Claude for at least half of their idea submissions, with 8% employing these technologies for every single submission. Of those using GenAI, 47% are leveraging it specifically for idea generation.\nThe Wazoku Crowd\u2019s collective intelligence is harnessed to solve \u2018challenges\u2019 \u2013 requests for ideas submitted by enterprises \u2013 with an impressive success rate of over 80%.\nSimon Hill, CEO of Wazoku, commented on the findings: \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible amount of hype with GenAI, but alongside that there is enormous curiosity. Getting immersed in something and being curious is an innovator\u2019s dream, so there is rich potential with GenAI.\u201d\nHowever, Hill also urged caution: \u201cA note of caution, though \u2013 it is best used to generate interest, not solutions. Human ingenuity and creativity are still best, although using GenAI can undoubtedly make that process more effective.\u201d\nThe study revealed that the most common application of GenAI was in research and learning, with 85% of respondents using it for this purpose. Additionally, around one-third of the Wazoku Crowd employed GenAI for report structuring, writing, and data analysis and insight.\nThe research was conducted in partnership with Oguz A. Acar, Professor of Marketing and Innovation at King\u2019s Business School, King\u2019s College London. Professor Acar viewed the study as a crucial first step towards understanding AI\u2019s potential and limitations in tackling complex innovation challenges.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to figure out what AI can and can\u2019t do, and this survey is a step forward in understanding that,\u201d Professor Acar stated. \u201cIt reveals that some crowd members view GenAI as a valuable ally, using it to research, create, and communicate more effectively.\u201d\n\u201cWhile perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that those open to innovation are curious about new tools, the survey also shows mixed opinions. Most people haven\u2019t used GenAI tools yet, highlighting that we\u2019re only beginning to uncover AI\u2019s potential in innovative problem-solving.\u201d\nWazoku collaborates with a range of customers, including Sanofi, A2A, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and numerous global enterprise businesses, government departments, and not-for-profits, to crowdsource ideas and innovation.\nRecently, Wazoku launched its own conversational AI to aid innovation. Dubbed Jen AI, this digital innovation assistant has access to Wazoku\u2019s connected innovation management suite\u2014aimed at accelerating decision-making around innovation and enhancing productivity to deliver consistent, scalable results.\n\u201cThe solutions to the world\u2019s problems are complex, and the support of AI brings vast benefits in terms of efficiency, creativity, and insight generation,\u201d explained Hill.\nAs the adoption of AI in innovation processes continues to grow, it\u2019s clear that \u2013 while these tools offer significant potential \u2013 they are best used to augment rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving skills.\n(Photo by Ally Griffin)\nSee also: Ivo Everts, Databricks: Enhancing open-source AI and improving data governance\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nAs data management grows more complex and modern applications extend the capabilities of traditional approaches, AI is revolutionising application scaling.\nHan Heloir, EMEA gen AI senior solutions architect, MongoDB.\nIn addition to freeing operators from outdated, inefficient methods that require careful supervision and extra resources, AI enables real-time, adaptive optimisation of application scaling. Ultimately, these benefits combine to enhance efficiency and reduce costs for targeted applications.\nWith its predictive capabilities, AI ensures that applications scale efficiently, improving performance and resource allocation\u2014marking a major advance over conventional methods.\nAhead of AI & Big Data Expo Europe, Han Heloir, EMEA gen AI senior solutions architect at MongoDB, discusses the future of AI-powered applications and the role of scalable databases in supporting generative AI and enhancing business processes.\nAI News: As AI-powered applications continue to grow in complexity and scale, what do you see as the most significant trends shaping the future of database technology?\nHeloir: While enterprises are keen to leverage the transformational power of generative AI technologies, the reality is that building a robust, scalable technology foundation involves more than just choosing the right technologies. It\u2019s about creating systems that can grow and adapt to the evolving demands of generative AI, demands that are changing quickly, some of which traditional IT infrastructure may not be able to support. That is the uncomfortable truth about the current situation.\nToday\u2019s IT architectures are being overwhelmed by unprecedented data volumes generated from increasingly interconnected data sets. Traditional systems, designed for less intensive data exchanges, are currently unable to handle the massive, continuous data streams required for real-time AI responsiveness. They are also unprepared to manage the variety of data being generated.\nThe generative AI ecosystem often comprises a complex set of technologies. Each layer of technology\u2014from data sourcing to model deployment\u2014increases functional depth and operational costs. Simplifying these technology stacks isn\u2019t just about improving operational efficiency; it\u2019s also a financial necessity.\nAI News: What are some key considerations for businesses when selecting a scalable database for AI-powered applications, especially those involving generative AI?\nHeloir: Businesses should prioritise flexibility, performance and future scalability. Here are a few key reasons:\nThe variety and volume of data will continue to grow, requiring the database to handle diverse data types\u2014structured, unstructured, and semi-structured\u2014at scale. Selecting a database that can manage such variety without complex ETL processes is important.\nAI models often need access to real-time data for training and inference, so the database must offer low latency to enable real-time decision-making and responsiveness.\nAs AI models grow and data volumes expand, databases must scale horizontally, to allow organisations to add capacity without significant downtime or performance degradation.\nSeamless integration with data science and machine learning tools is crucial, and native support for AI workflows\u2014such as managing model data, training sets and inference data\u2014can enhance operational efficiency.\nAI News: What are the common challenges organisations face when integrating AI into their operations, and how can scalable databases help address these issues?\nHeloir: There are a variety of challenges that organisations can run into when adopting AI. These include the massive amounts of data from a wide variety of sources that are required to build AI applications. Scaling these initiatives can also put strain on the existing IT infrastructure and once the models are built, they require continuous iteration and improvement.\nTo make this easier, a database that scales can help simplify the management, storage and retrieval of diverse datasets. It offers elasticity, allowing businesses to handle fluctuating demands while sustaining performance and efficiency. Additionally, they accelerate time-to-market for AI-driven innovations by enabling rapid data ingestion and retrieval, facilitating faster experimentation.\nAI News: Could you provide examples of how collaborations between database providers and AI-focused companies have driven innovation in AI solutions?\nHeloir: Many businesses struggle to build generative AI applications because the technology evolves so quickly. Limited expertise and the increased complexity of integrating diverse components further complicate the process, slowing innovation and hindering the development of AI-driven solutions.\nOne way we address these challenges is through our MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP), which provides customers with resources to assist them in putting AI applications into production. This includes reference architectures and an end-to-end technology stack that integrates with leading technology providers, professional services and a unified support system.\nMAAP categorises customers into four groups, ranging from those seeking advice and prototyping to those developing mission-critical AI applications and overcoming technical challenges. MongoDB\u2019s MAAP enables faster, seamless development of generative AI applications, fostering creativity and reducing complexity.\nAI News: How does MongoDB approach the challenges of supporting AI-powered applications, particularly in industries that are rapidly adopting AI?\nHeloir: Ensuring you have the underlying infrastructure to build what you need is always one of the biggest challenges organisations face.\nTo build AI-powered applications, the underlying database must be capable of running queries against rich, flexible data structures. With AI, data structures can become very complex. This is one of the biggest challenges organisations face when building AI-powered applications, and it\u2019s precisely what MongoDB is designed to handle. We unify source data, metadata, operational data, vector data and generated data\u2014all in one platform.\nAI News: What future developments in database technology do you anticipate, and how is MongoDB preparing to support the next generation of AI applications?\nHeloir: Our key values are the same today as they were when MongoDB initially launched: we want to make developers\u2019 lives easier and help them drive business ROI. This remains unchanged in the age of artificial intelligence. We will continue to listen to our customers, assist them in overcoming their biggest difficulties, and ensure that MongoDB has the features they require to develop the next [generation of] great applications.\n(Photo by Caspar Camille Rubin)\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Photo By Ramsey Cardy / Sportsfile for Collision via Getty ImagesTwo scientists credited with laying the \u201cfoundation of today\u2019s powerful machine learning,\u201d University of Toronto professor emeritus Geoffrey Hinton and Princeton University professor John Hopfield, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics today.Their discoveries and inventions laid the groundwork for many of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Since the 1980s, their work has enabled the creation of artificial neural networks, computer architecture\u00a0loosely modeled after the structure of the brain. By mimicking the way our brains make connections, neural networks allow AI tools to essentially \u201clearn by example.\u201d Developers can train an artificial neural network to recognize complex patterns by feeding it data, undergirding some of the most high-profile uses of AI today, from language generation to image recognition. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.\u201d\u201cI had no expectations of this. I am extremely surprised and I\u2019m honoured to be included,\u201d a \u201cflabbergasted\u201d Hinton said in a University of Toronto news release.Hinton, often called \u201cThe Godfather of AI,\u201d told The New York Times last year that \u201ca part of him ... now regrets his life\u2019s work.\u201d He reportedly left his post at Google in 2023 in order to be able to call attention to the potential risks posed by the technology he was instrumental in bringing to fruition. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Hinton said in the NYT interview. In 2013, Google acquired Hinton\u2019s neural networks company, which he started with two students, including Ilya Sutskever who would later become chief scientist at OpenAI before leaving this year.The Nobel committee recognized Hinton for developing what\u2019s called the Boltzmann machine, a generative model, with colleagues in the 1980s:Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive development of machine learning.Hinton\u2019s work builds on fellow awardee John Hopfield\u2019s Hopfield network, an artificial neural network that can recreate patterns: The\u00a0Hopfield network\u00a0utilises physics that describes a material\u2019s characteristics due to its atomic spin \u2013 a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network as a whole is described in a manner equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in physics, and is trained by finding values for the connections between the nodes so that the saved images have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works through the nodes and updates their values so the network\u2019s energy falls. The network thus works stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with.Hinton continues to raise his concerns with AI, including in a call today with reporters. \u201cWe have no experience of what it\u2019s like to have things smarter than us. And it\u2019s going to be wonderful in many respects,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.\u201dCommentsMost PopularMost PopularGoogle must crack open Android for third-party stores, rules Epic judgeAnother major hurricane is approaching Florida, one of the most rapidly intensifying on recordData breach leaks SSNs of over 230,000 Comcast customersPersona director says making beautiful menus is \u2018actually really annoying\u2019Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn\u2019t thinking too far aheadVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nIn the near future, Silicon Valley might look back at recent events as the point where the generative AI craze went too far.\nThis past summer, investors questioned whether top AI stocks could sustain their sky-high valuations, given the lack of returns on massive AI spending. As Autumn approaches, major AI sectors\u2014such as chips, LLMs, and AI devices\u2014received renewed confidence. Nonetheless, there are an increasing number of reasons to be cautious.\nCerebras: A chip contender with a major risk\nChip startup Cerebras is challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance by developing processors designed to power smarter LLMs. Nvidia, a major player in the AI boom, has seen its market cap skyrocket from $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion.\nCerebras, however, relies heavily on a single customer: the Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. In 2023, G42 accounted for 83% of Cerebras\u2019 revenue, and in the first half of 2024, that figure increased to 87%. While G42 is backed by major players like Microsoft and Silver Lake, its dependency poses a risk. Even though Cerebras has signed a deal with Saudi Aramco, its reliance on one client may cause concerns as it seeks a $7-8 billion valuation for its IPO.\nOpenAI\u2019s record-breaking funding \u2013 but with strings attached\nOpenAI made the news when it raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, becoming the largest investment round in Silicon Valley history. However, the company has urged its investors not to back competitors such as Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI\u2014an unusual request in the world of venture capital, where spread betting is common. Critics, including Gary Marcus, have described this approach as \u201crunning scared.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s backers also include \u201cbubble chasers\u201d such as SoftBank and Tiger Global, firms known for investing in companies at their peak, which frequently results in huge losses. With top executives such as CTO Mira Murati departing and predicted losses of $5 billion this year despite rising revenues, OpenAI faces significant challenges.\nMeta\u2019s big bet on AI wearables\nMeta entered the AI race by unveiling Orion, its augmented reality glasses. The wearables promise to integrate AI into daily life, with Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang endorsing the product. However, at a production cost of $10,000 per unit, the price is a major obstacle.\nMeta will need to reduce costs and overcome consumer hesitation, as previous attempts at AI-powered wearables\u2014such as Snapchat\u2019s glasses, Google Glass, and the Humane AI pin\u2014have struggled to gain traction.\nThe road ahead\nWhat\u2019s next for AI? OpenAI must prove it can justify a $157 billion valuation while operating at a loss. Cerebras needs to reassure investors that relying on one client isn\u2019t a dealbreaker. And Meta must convince consumers to adopt a completely new way of interacting with AI.\nIf these companies succeed, this moment could mark a turning point in the AI revolution. However, as tech history shows, high-stakes markets are rarely easy to win.\n(Photo by Growtika)\nSee also: Ethical, trust and skill barriers hold back generative AI progress in EMEA\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

It says its AI agents might someday be smart enough to buy you stuff without you even having to ask.FacebookXEmailSave StoryPhoto-Illustration: WIRED Staff/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveAmazon might not have ChatGPT, but it has a roadmap that includes developing even more advanced forms of artificial intelligence\u2014including AI agents that are hell-bent on helping you buy stuff.The ecommerce company is already sprinkling ChatGPT-like AI over its website and apps\u2014today announcing, among other enhancements, AI-generated shopping guides for hundreds of different product categories. Executives at the company say its engineers are also exploring more ambitious AI services, including autonomous AI shopping agents that recommend goods to a customer or even add items to their cart.\u201cIt\u2019s on our roadmap. We\u2019re working on it, prototyping it, and when we think it\u2019s good enough, we\u2019ll release it in whatever form makes sense,\u201d says Trishul Chilimbi, a VP and distinguished scientist at Amazon who works on applying the company\u2019s core AI to its products and services.Sign UpThis is an edition of WIRED's AI Lab newsletter by resident AI expert Will Knight. Get it in your inbox every week.Chilimbi says the first step toward AI agents will likely be chatbots that proactively recommend products based on what they know of your habits and interests, as well as a grasp of broader trends. He acknowledges that making this feel nonintrusive will be crucial. \u201cIf it\u2019s no good and annoying, then you\u2019ll tune it out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it comes up with surprising things that are interesting, you\u2019ll use it more.\u201dAmazon added a chatbot called Rufus to its platform in February 2024 that can answer a wide range of questions about Amazon\u2019s many products. The bot uses a bespoke large language model\u2014the kind of algorithm that powers ChatGPT\u2014also known as Rufus.The Rufus LLM is trained on vast amounts of internet text\u2014like those on publicly available websites\u2014and is then fine-tuned into a commerce-focused model by being fed a carefully curated diet of Amazon\u2019s proprietary data. Chilimbi says Amazon\u2019s LLM has \u201chundreds of billions of parameters.\u201d (Parameters are a rough measure of capability; for comparison, Meta\u2019s largest publicly available LLM has 405 billion.) He confirmed that Amazon is training a larger model, but declined to say how large it is or what capabilities Amazon hopes it will unlock.Like many tech companies, Amazon is looking beyond chat and turning its attention toward the potential of so-called agents, which use LLMs but attempt to carry out useful tasks on users\u2019 behalf either by writing code on-the-fly, inputing text, or moving a computer\u2019s cursor. Future AI agents might, for instance, navigate various websites to sort out a parking ticket, or they might operate a PC to file a tax return. Getting LLM-powered programs to do this reliably is elusive, however, because such tasks are vastly more complex than simple queries and require a new level of precision and reliability.\u201cEvery major company is now doing [AI] agents,\u201d says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who is working on AI agents. The technology is exciting, he says, because it promises to automate countless routine tasks that people do every day: \u201cOn the ecommerce side, if agents can find the best possible outcome for me, that's amazing.\u201dSalakhutdinov and colleagues at CMU developed a dummy ecommerce website as part of a platform called Visual Web Arena for testing AI agents. Key challenges include enabling agents to better make sense of visual information and training them to explore vast arrays of possible options while zooming in on the correct one\u2014something that may require more advanced reasoning abilities.Most PopularGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuSecurityLicense Plate Readers Are Creating a US-Wide Database of More Than Just CarsBy Matt BurgessGearThe Best Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon HillGearThe Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for EveryoneBy Adrienne SoBut Salakhutdinov says that having a wealth of information about how users go about common and important tasks like shopping might be a crucial ingredient for getting them to stay on track. \u201cData is going to be very important,\u201d he says.Ship ItAmazon\u2019s agents are, of course, likely to be more focused on helping customers find and buy whatever they need or want. A Rufus agent might notice when the next book in a series someone is reading becomes available and then automatically recommend it, add it to your cart, or even buy it for you, says Rajiv Mehta, a vice president at Amazon who works on conversational AI shopping. \u201cIt could say, \u2018We have one bought for you. We can ship it today, and it will arrive tomorrow morning at your door. Would you like that?\u2019\u201d Mehta says. He adds that Amazon is thinking about how advertising can be incorporated into its model's recommendation.Chilimbi and Mehta say that eventually, an agent might go on a shopping spree when a customer says, \u201cI\u2019m going on a camping trip, buy me everything I need.\u201d An extreme, though not impossible, scenario would involve agents that decide for themselves when a customer needs something, and then buy and ship it to their door. \u201cYou could maybe give it a budget,\u201d Chilimbi says with a grin.Amazon\u2019s new AI-generated shopping guides, announced at its Reinvent conference in Nashville today and initially available on the company\u2019s US mobile website and app, are a small step toward the ultimate vision of a superintelligent shopping assistant. The Rufus LLM is used to autogenerate the sort of information and insights that could take someone hours of online research to gather. \u201cIf you ever try to shop in a category you're not familiar with, it can be pretty time-consuming to understand the lay of the land, the different features available, and the different selections,\u201d says Brett Canfield, a senior product manager on the personalization team at Amazon.Canfield showed WIRED shopping guides for televisions and earbuds that noted important technical features, explanations of key terminology, and, of course, recommendations on which products to buy. The underlying LLM has access to the vast corpus of product information, customer questions, reviews, and feedback, and users\u2019 buying habits. \u201cThis is really only possible with generative AI,\u201d Canfield says.The new shopping guides highlight generative AI\u2019s potential in ecommerce, creating guides for product categories too niche to normally get the treatment. \u201cThe definitive hedge trimmers,\u201d for instance.Guide SuppliesThe guides also, however, show how generative AI threatens to upend the economics of search and shopping while borrowing liberally from conventional publishers.AI-generated search results often now provide product comparisons and opinions.

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\nChina Telecom, one of the country\u2019s state-owned telecom giants, has created two LLMs that were trained solely on domestically-produced chips.\nThis breakthrough represents a significant step in China\u2019s ongoing efforts to become self-reliant in AI technology, especially in light of escalating US limitations on access to advanced semiconductors for its competitors.\nAccording to the company\u2019s Institute of AI, one of the models, TeleChat2-115B and another unnamed model were trained on tens of thousands of Chinese-made chips. This achievement is especially noteworthy given the tighter US export rules that have limited China\u2019s ability to purchase high-end processors from Nvidia and other foreign companies. In a statement shared on WeChat, the AI institute claimed that this accomplishment demonstrated China\u2019s capability to independently train LLMs and signals a new era of innovation and self-reliance in AI technology.\nThe scale of these models is remarkable. China Telecom stated that the unnamed LLM has one trillion parameters. In AI terminology, parameters are the variables that help the model in learning during training. The more parameters there are, the more complicated and powerful the AI becomes.\nChinese companies are striving to keep pace with global leaders in AI based outside the country. Washington\u2019s export restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s latest AI chips such as the A100 and H100, have compelled China to seek alternatives. As a result, Chinese companies have developed their own processors to reduce reliance on Western technologies. For instance, the TeleChat2-115B model has approximately 100 billion parameters, and therefore can perform as well as mainstream platforms.\nChina Telecom did not specify which company supplied the domestically-designed chips used to train its models. However, as previously discussed on these pages, Huawei\u2019s Ascend chips play a key part in the country\u2019s AI plans.\nHuawei, which has faced US penalties in recent years, is also increasing its efforts in the artificial intelligence field. The company has recently started testing its latest AI processor, the Ascend 910C, with potential clients waiting in the domestic market. Large Chinese server companies, as well as internet giants that have previously used Nvidia chips, are apparently testing the new chip\u2019s performance. Huawei\u2019s Ascend processors, as one of the few viable alternatives to Nvidia hardware, are viewed as a key component of China\u2019s strategy that will lessen its reliance on foreign technology.\nIn addition to Huawei, China Telecom is collaborating with other domestic chipmakers such as Cambricon, a Chinese start-up specialising in AI processors. The partnerships reflect a broader tendency in China\u2019s tech industry to build a homegrown ecosystem of AI solutions, further shielding the country from the effects of US export controls.\nBy developing its own AI chips and technology, China is gradually reducing its dependence on foreign-made hardware, especially Nvidia\u2019s highly sought-after and therefore expensive GPUs. While US sanctions make it difficult for Chinese companies to obtain the latest Nvidia hardware, a black market for foreign chips has emerged. Rather than risk operating in the grey market, many Chinese companies prefer to purchase lower-powered alternatives such as previous-gen models to maintain access to Nvidia\u2019s official support and services.\nChina\u2019s achievement reflects a broader shift in its approach to AI and semiconductor technology, emphasising self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive global economy and in face of American protectionist trade policies.\n(Photo by Mark Kuiper)\nSee also: Has Huawei outsmarted Apple in the AI race?\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Nevertheless, fundamental cybersecurity practices \u2013 such as data encryption, employee education, and advanced threat detection \u2013 continue to be essential. Organisations must ensure these essential measures are consistently re-evaluated and adjusted to counter emerging threats.\nIn addition to these core practices, advanced security frameworks like zero trust and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions can bolster an organisation\u2019s resilience.\nZero trust demands continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications, reducing the risk of unauthorised access and minimising potential damage during an attack. PAM offers targeted security for an organisation\u2019s most sensitive accounts, crucial for defending against complex AI-driven threats that aim at high-level credentials.\nDarren Guccione, CEO and Co-Founder of Keeper Security, commented: \u201cAI-driven attacks are a formidable challenge, but by reinforcing our cybersecurity fundamentals and adopting advanced security measures, we can build resilient defences against these evolving threats.\u201d\nProactivity is also key for organisations\u2014regularly reviewing security policies, performing routine audits, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness are all essential.\nWhile organisations are advancing, cybersecurity requires perpetual vigilance. Merging traditional practices with modern approaches like zero trust and PAM will empower organisations to maintain an edge over developing AI-powered threats.\n(Photo by Growtika)\nSee also: King\u2019s Business School: How AI is transforming problem-solving\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?
