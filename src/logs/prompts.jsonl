Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> .

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

This report provides an overview of the key new features of the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model, a lightweight and powerful addition to the Phi-3 family.\n\n**Architecture and Training**\n\nThe Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model has 4.2 billion parameters and consists of an image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model. It was trained on a massive dataset of 500 billion vision and text tokens, using a combination of publicly available documents, educational data, synthetic data, and high-quality image-text interleave. The model was trained on 512 H100-80G GPUs for 1.5 days.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n1. **Multimodal capabilities**: The model can process both text and image inputs, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including visual question answering, image captioning, and conversational AI.\n2. **Long context length**: The model has a context length of 128K tokens, allowing it to process and understand long-range dependencies in text and image inputs.\n3. **Chat format**: The model is designed to work with chat format inputs, making it suitable for conversational AI applications.\n4. **High-quality performance**: The model has achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of zero-shot benchmarks, including MMBench, ScienceQA, MathVista, and InterGPS.\n\n**Responsible AI Considerations**\n\nThe Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model, like other AI models, has the potential to behave unfairly or unreliably. Developers should be aware of these limitations and take steps to mitigate them, including applying responsible AI best practices, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and implementing safeguards to prevent misuse.\n\n**Technical Requirements**\n\nThe model requires specific GPU hardware to run, including NVIDIA A100, A6000, and H100 GPUs. It is licensed under the MIT license and is available for download on the Hugging Face model hub.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is a powerful and lightweight addition to the Phi-3 family, offering state-of-the-art multimodal capabilities and high-quality performance on a variety of tasks. Its chat format input capabilities and long context length make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including conversational AI and visual question answering.

The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\".

Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> .

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nPhi-3 Microsoft Blog\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nPhi-3 on Azure AI Studio\nPhi-3 Cookbook\nShort Context\nLong Context\nMini\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX] ; [GGUF]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nSmall\n8K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nMedium\n4K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\nVision\n128K [HF] ; [ONNX]\n\t\tIntended Uses\nPrimary use cases\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \nmemory/compute constrained environments;\nlatency bound scenarios;\ngeneral image understanding;\nOCR;\nchart and table understanding.\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse case considerations\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\t\tHow to Use\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of transformers. Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\nRelease Type: Open weight release\nRelease dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\t\tDatasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \npublicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\nselected high-quality image-text interleave;\nnewly created synthetic, \u201ctextbook-like\u201d data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\nMore details can be found in the Phi-3 Technical Report.\n\t\tBenchmarks\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\nBenchmark\nPhi-3 Vision-128K-In\nLlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B\nQWEN-VL Chat\nLlama3-Llava-Next-8B\nClaude-3 Haiku\nGemini 1.0 Pro V\nGPT-4V-Turbo\nMMMU\n40.4\n34.2\n39.0\n36.4\n40.7\n42.0\n55.5\nMMBench\n80.5\n76.3\n75.8\n79.4\n62.4\n80.0\n86.1\nScienceQA\n90.8\n70.6\n67.2\n73.7\n72.0\n79.7\n75.7\nMathVista\n44.5\n31.5\n29.4\n34.8\n33.2\n35.0\n47.5\nInterGPS\n38.1\n20.5\n22.3\n24.6\n32.1\n28.6\n41.0\nAI2D\n76.7\n63.1\n59.8\n66.9\n60.3\n62.8\n74.7\nChartQA\n81.4\n55.0\n50.9\n65.8\n59.3\n58.0\n62.3\nTextVQA\n70.9\n64.6\n59.4\n55.7\n62.7\n64.7\n68.1\nPOPE\n85.8\n87.2\n82.6\n87.0\n74.4\n84.2\n83.7\n\t\tSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\n\t\tHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

Until the official version is released through pip, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\nWhen loading the model, ensure that trust_remote_code=True is passed as an argument of the from_pretrained() function.\nUpdate your local transformers to the development version: pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\nThe current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nExamples of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio.\n\t\tChat Format\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \nwhere the model generates the text after <|assistant|> . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n{response_1}<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n \n\t\tSample inference code\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\" \nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=\"auto\", _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2') # use _attn_implementation='eager' to disable flash attention\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \nmessages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|image_1|>\\nWhat is shown in this image?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include: \nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. \nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated. \nLimited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nIdentification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n\t\tTraining\n\t\tModel\nArchitecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\nInputs: Text and Image.

This move has significant implications for the EU's position in technological innovation and its ability to balance concerns about AI's societal impacts.\n\n**Meta's Decision**\n\nMeta has stated that it will not launch its upcoming multimodal AI model in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment. This decision means that European companies will not be able to utilize this technology, potentially putting them at a disadvantage in the global AI race. A text-only version of Meta's Llama 3 model is still expected to launch in the EU.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe withholding of advanced AI models from the EU market creates a challenging situation for companies outside the region. Those hoping to provide products and services utilizing these models will be unable to offer them in one of the world's largest economic markets. This could lead to a brain drain, as European companies may need to relocate to access these technologies.\n\n**Regulatory Environment**\n\nThe EU has recently finalized compliance deadlines for its new AI Act, which sets rules surrounding copyright, transparency, and specific AI applications like predictive policing. Tech companies operating in the EU will have until August 2026 to comply with these rules. However, the regulatory environment remains unpredictable, leading to uncertainty for tech companies.\n\n**Industry Impact**\n\nThe decision by Meta and Apple to withhold AI models from the EU may lead to a growing trend of tech giants hesitating to introduce advanced AI technologies in the region. This could have significant implications for the EU's position in technological innovation and its ability to balance concerns about AI's societal impacts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe decision by Meta and Apple to withhold AI models from the EU is a significant development in the tech industry. The implications of this move are far-reaching, and the EU must balance its regulatory environment with the need to attract and retain tech companies. As the tech industry continues to evolve, it is essential to monitor the impact of this decision and its implications for the EU's position in technological innovation.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. The EU should work to create a more predictable regulatory environment to attract and retain tech companies.\n2. Tech companies should engage in open dialogue with regulators to ensure that AI models are developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner.\n3.

Last month, Apple made a similar move, withholding its Apple Intelligence features from Europe over regulatory concerns.\nMeta's primary issue stems from difficulties in training AI models using European user data while complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In June, the company was ordered to pause AI training on EU data after announcing plans to use public posts from Facebook and Instagram users.\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta's lead privacy regulator in Europe, said discussions with the company over model training were ongoing.\nDespite nearly identical data protection laws, Meta plans to launch the new model for UK users, citing less regulatory uncertainty in Britain.\nThe withholding of the multimodal AI model could have far-reaching implications for European businesses and consumers.
