# Tweet Crafter: AI-Powered Tweet Writing with Multi-Agent System

**Tweet Crafter** is a multi-agent AI system designed to generate high-quality tweets by leveraging the power of autonomous agents. Each agent in the system plays a unique role in the process, collaborating to create insightful, research-backed social media posts.

## Key AI Agents and Their Roles

1. **Website Scraper**: Scrapes relevant content from a set of provided URLs.
2. **Researcher**: Extracts key insights and information from the scraped content and any additional research sources.
3. **Social Media Writer**: Crafts a tweet based on the research findings provided by the Researcher.
4. **Tweet Editor**: Critiques the initial tweet and provides three refined versions of it based on the original research report.

## How Tweet Crafter Works

The `tweetcrafter_crew` is a group of specialized AI agents, each configured for specific tasks. These tasks are defined in the `config/tasks.yaml` file, while the capabilities and settings of each agent are outlined in `config/agents.yaml`.

### Workflow

1. The **Website Scraper** pulls content from the URLs you provide.
2. The **Researcher** processes the content, extracting insights.
3. The **Social Media Writer** takes these insights and creates a tweet.
4. The **Tweet Editor** refines the tweet, offering three alternative versions for optimization.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open `tweetcrafter_crew/main.py` and configure the input parameters:

    ```python
    inputs = {
        "topic": "Many organisations unprepared for AI cybersecurity threats",
        "urls": [
            "https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/many-organisations-unprepared-ai-cybersecurity-threats/",
        ],
        "suggestion": "",
    }
    ```

2. Add sample tweets to analyze their writing style by editing `data/tweets.md`.

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    poetry run tweetcrafter_crew
    ```

## Sample Output

Once the agents have completed their tasks, you will find the resulting tweets saved in `output/tweet.md`.

**Example**:

**Original Tweet**:
```
